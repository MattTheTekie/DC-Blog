<summary class=big>Base64 And Its Uses In HTML</summary>
Base64 seems like a stupid idea at first, but its actually surprisingly cool of an idea. It certainly isn't perfect by no means, but depending on what weird stuff you wanna do, it might be useful. This will be a long blog which is why it is in the essay section.

<summary>DSi Browser/3DS Browser HTML Pages</summary>
This is one of the unusual uses of Base64. Making a website for DSi/O3DS via Base64. This sounds stupid, but an HTML file like it is just a long string you could put as a DSiPaint/3DSPaint bio which would be the entire website. As a result, this is already a good use of the service. I will display the idea itself below for reference.

As you can tell, DSi can do Base64. No more custom domains for 1-page websites I guess? Well kinda, you still need to be able to either type the 1024 characters of Base64 or click the link somewhere instead. A cool idea for people like me who just want to bring their creations to DSi/3DS more easily without having to figure out how in the hell to make a real website for it.
<br><br>
The DSi is an older console so obviously, what you can do on it will be much harder and require a lot of effort to recreate what you can do in HTML5, but this is pretty cool still. Now one thing that sucks about this thing on the DSi is that you are unable to bookmark bigger pages so you will still need some other way to get it. preferably, you copy the B64 string and save it somewhere, but where? Well that is what I don't know. Despite the DSi loading links over 1024 characters long, it doesnt let you save those links. I wonder how far you actually can go, but you would have to be careful with this lol.
<br><br>
I am hosting that page via DSiPaint/3DSPaint because I have no other way to do this stuff. I will probably not use this feature of it much because I don't want to risk getting banned and I'm already pushing it with what I'm doing now. Some may argue this could be used for images not having to be uploaded, but [image] already exists which actually does exactly that potentially (just usually via something like an IMGUR link).

I may expand further if HullBreach is ok with me doing something like that, but I would not do it unless its extremely short just in case. Still could be cool, offline-ish pages are always cool. Oh yea, the image here is encoded as Base64.

<summary>Neocities</summary>
This one use is Neocities specific. It is for files that are not the normal stuff they allow. As of 2023, you can not upload files like .zip without paying $5 monthly or using another service and directly linking it like GitHub. But this would actually allow you to do archives like cip/7z or media like mp3/mp4 without any issues. Well kinda.
<br><br>
Whenever you do something like that it is just linking this really long (and I mean looooooong) text right? However it basically just being a really really long link is not good if you want your loading times to be reasonable. That long text lags the page a lot for some reason.
<br><br>
I'm not the best at explaining so hopefully I explained it ok-ish above. It is a cool idea for smaller things like DSi websites, it is a terrible idea for larger media thats anything over a few KB because then it starts being laggy as hell. For example, a 5.84MB flipnote archive should be easy to download right? Well if I just try putting the Base64 string on there, it is long and lags to death.
<br><br>
You could make an entire HTML file for it to reduce lag on something like a downloads page, but that is fucking stupid. Why would you even do that? While it may be a better option, it isn't gonna work longterm especially with the 500 file limit of Neocities unless you only have a few files.
<br><br>
You could try just a single page for all long downloads like this, but once again lag is an issue. Overall, there are issues with it but it might be useful to a few people such as myself who wanna do weirder stuff or are desperately trying to avoid just giving $5 monthly for actually good features (even if we probably spend so much time we could've just paid and made that money back by now somehow).
</details>
<details>
<summary>Base64 Conversion</summary>
Ok that is cool and all, but how do we convert into Base64 and how do we use it anyways? Well that is pretty simple. There are two tools you can use for it that I know of. Base64.GURU seems to be the most useful, but Blueturtle's Website might be useful assuming something isn't going well with the first option. If you can figure it out yourself, you may stop reading. Otherwise, I will explain some of what I've learned as of now. I will not go through literally every option as that will take too long and I haven't figured out everything yet.
<h2><a href="https://base64.guru/converter/encode/html">HTML Pages</a></h2>
An unusual use for it already, I have only gotten this use working on DSi/N3DS so far. It might be my browser but I am not sure. As of writing this, I use the Firefox Developer browser so tell me if that might affect anything.
<br><br>
Ok so to do this, it will depend. You have a few options for every converter, but on this one we will focus on 2 specific ones. HTML Hyperlinks (for personal websites/sites that support HTML in posts/pages) and Data URIs (useful for places like 3DSPaint or if you just wanna change the link of something).
<br><br>
Doesn't matter if you are using 3DSPaint BBCode or HTML Hyperlinks, the Data URI will be there. However, HTML Hyperlinks is a built-in option for the Base64 converter so it is worth considering a look at. With that out the way, I will show you how to do Base64 HTML.
<h4>HTML Hyperlinks</h4>

<h4>BBCode</h4>

</textarea>
<h2><a href="https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image">Images</a></h2>
Yes, you can do images too. This would probably be much more useful such as sending less compressed images on 3DSPaint without using an alternative service like imgur which would keep it DSi compatible. Really small images that are barely a few KB will probably not be an issue. Bigger images might start being an issue and you should work on trying to compress the image with something like <a href=https://jpegcompress.com>JPEGCompress</a> or <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a>
<h4>HTML Hyperlinks</h4>

<h2><a href="https://base64.guru/converter/encode/audio">Audio</a>/<a href="https://base64.guru/converter/encode/video">Video</a></h2>
Audio/video isn't supported on 3DSPaint and probably isn't supported directly by most websites. As a result, I will just do the HTML example here. I would definitely not recommend video due to the file-size of most video files (even when heavily compressed, it is usually huge). I would instead recommend using YouTube (20GB per video), Guilded (500MB per file), or another place. But if you choose to do so, you can actually do so even if horribly.
<h4>HTML Hyperlinks</h4>
<textarea readonly>HTML Video
<video src="Base64"></video>

HTML Audio
<audio src="Base64"></audio>
</textarea>
<h2>Other Formats</h2>
This will contain info about txt files and just the regular file option (mostly used for things not listed such as .7z archives). Plain text is a weird thing to use with it as DSi doesn't support .txt files, but its a cool idea. .zip files will probably be what you came here for along with .7z files because you can't directly upload them to Neocities. These files also can't be viewed on some really legacy devices like DSi, but that isn't an issue for you probably.

Make sure to do <b style=color:gold>download="Filename.filetype"</b> after the link for the file. Even if somehow it isn't needed, its a good idea just in case. There are obviously more files, but it would be impossible for me to go through each and every file to tell you exactly how to convert it properly unfortunately.
</details>
<br>
Overall, Base64 can actually be a pretty useful tool when used properly. It isn't very efficient for stuff like videos and other things such as it, but it might be useful if you needed to do minor stuff to get around hosting restrictions or for making HTML pages on legacy devices without having to host an entire website for it and figure out all that other BS.

<summary class=big>File Naming/Storing/Sorting - A Complicated Art</summary>
So you wanna name your files and make sure everything is sorted. That isn't normally too hard, just name the file and put it in whatever folder you want it to be. However on a hosting service like Neocities, this may become an issue.
<br><br>
Neocities in specific (but probably many other hosts) let you have 500 files before you will be unable to normally download your website. If you pay for Neocities supporters, you can probably use WebDAV to ignore this (in which case, you don't need this page so go read something else unless you're just bored). If you are like me and do not pay for Neocities supporter whether you don't want to or literally can't, this guide is for you.
<br><br>
At first 500 files seems like a surprisingly high amount because it probably is for the average person. Thats likely many images, pages, and more. But whenever you archive 250+ 3DSPaint blogs of yours, many paintings, and more from other websites to put on one site in a convenient to view fashion, it starts really being a small amount. Imagine over half of your 500 file soft-limit being just archives of your old pages. That doesn't sound fun does it?
<br><br>
Well luckily there is a solution. We aren't too concerned with how much space it takes up usually because 1GB is a lot until you get to audio files and videos (neither of which supported by free neocities accounts and Soundcloud/YouTube would be better for that job).
<br><br>
We are specifically talking about the file soft-limit because that is where the issues start to appear. I will note that some of the things I'm discussing here may help you cut down on the file-size a bit anyways depending on how you do things. I saved a few KB whenever I moved everything onto a single page for the SDKCommunity archives because I didn't have to constantly put details in the <b>head</b> tag over and over again (also I got to cut down on code in general).
<br><br>
<details>
<summary>File Sorting/Folder Reduction</summary>
How do we efficiently sort files so things don't get put in millions of folders to never be found and eventually just reuploaded or accidently deleted? Well we try to make the folders clear what it is in the first place.
<br><br>
This is actually a very easy task. You don't do <b style=color:gold>/media/imgs/Assets/Archives/SDK/Art/DSi/DCTheGamr/Image.png</b>, you instead would want to do something basic like <b style=color:gold>media/Archives/SDK/Art/Image.png</b> because its both easier to find and saves on the file limit (yes, folders count towards the limit). However this may eventually become a problem because if you make it too simple then its just jumbled together.
<br><br>
You should try to have some standard as a way to cut down on folders and other useless BS. For example, don't make a line image thats 1x1 big, just do the <code>hr</code> tag instead because its only 4 letters long instead of a while of images and making sure the line doesn't get bigger via <b style=color:gold>max-height:1px</b>.
<br><br>
Now at this point you may be wondering, how do we make sure our files don't get too jumbled up with each other and how to efficiently cut down on image folders while still being easy to find anything? Well that is a more complicated subject which will be explained in the next spoiler. However in short, you just name things with heavy detail off of what they're for. This can get pretty confusing so I will start explaining in the next spoiler.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Big-Time Reduction Via File Names</summary>
<h2>Cutting Down On Useless Pages</h2>
If you read the last spoiler, you probably know we have to cut down the amount of folders used in general. But after a certain point, its much harder to cut down on the folders needed. This is where the advance naming tricks will come in. The only other way is to not make tons of useless shit that you will never use or update.
<br><br>
For this, lets pretend you want to archive all of your 3DSPaint blogs. Cool. Lets say you have several blogs that used a few images to show proof for things or game screenshots. Cool. Now how do we cut down on folders majorly to reduce it? Well starting off lets actually not do images of all things but make every blog on the same page. You can just make <code>summary</code> HTML classes and use CSS to make it look good while still being useful to cut down on pages. In fact, I did it myself. You can also put summary/detail tags inside of each other so I will show you how that looks below.
<br><br>
<textarea readonly><details>
<summary class=blog>2022 Blogs</summary>
<details>
<summary>Cool Blog | 4/20/2022 6:30pm</summary>
Very cool bleg!
</details>
</details>
</textarea>
<br>
Now try the same thing but having to put in the custom information such as title page each time you want to put a single blog on there. It will be much, much longer. This isn't a big deal for a few blogs, but really long blogs will have this issue.
<br><br>
After you do that for archives or pages that really aren't long enough to deserve a full page in the first place, how do you cut it down further? You would think you're as close as it gets but actually not. Once again we will use the blog archive example.
<h2>Smart File/Folder Naming</h2>
Starting off is how I would name the files. Normally, this would be how you might make the directories.
<blockquote style=color:gold><b>/IMGS/Archives/3DSPaint/Blog-Images/Blog-Title/1.png</b>
</blockquote>
As you can tell, that is very inefficient if you just wanna save folder space. Now here is a more optimal way to do things (especially if you also archive things you've made from several other websites)
<blockquote style=color:gold><b>/IMGS/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-BlogTitle_ImageID.png</b>
</blockquote>
Pretty easy to see how that is more efficient isn't it? You can also just change it to the blog/post ID of whatever it is but that might be an issue for some people (image titles will be smaller tho). Now this seems like I am leading you into the same trap of everything is jumbled up but not exactly. I will explain how the system works to reduce folders and also make it easier to find certain things.
<br><br>
First of all, what does <b>SDK-BlogTitle_ImageID.png</b> even mean? Well, that I will break down.
<blockquote>SDK-BlogTitle</blockquote>
SDK stands for SDKCommunity/3DSPaint (the website where the archived content comes from). BlogTitle stands for what the blog/post title would be (or ID if you did blog IDs instead).
<blockquote>ImageID</blockquote>
ImageID is for which image is it specifically off of a count of how many images. If there are 10 images, the ID will be anything from 1-10. If there are only 3 images, it will be anything from 1-3. This is per blog/post so never do something really stupid like saying there is an 11th image on a 10 image blog, that will end up confusing you eventually if you go back to find something.
<br><br>
The whole point of having it marked like that is so you can sort by what website, what blog, and then just search through very little (hopefully) to find the image you are looking for. This is pretty simple but there are some things to look out for when doing a method like this.
<h2>What To Look Out For</h2>
For one, you want to look out so that way you don't accidently have two websites named something similar and then get confused. Its pretty rare, but it is possible (that or you misspelled something and the sorting now doesn't work as expected). Also, make sure the blog/post title or ID is correct or else this will look weird when looking for images as well especially if you know what the original image was but can't find it.
<br><br>
Also, do not try to remove the blog title/ID at all unless you're ok with taking forever to find the right images (in which case, you probably aren't concerned about not being able to find stuff). If you do, it will just be something like <b style=color:gold>SDK_ImageID.png</b> which is less detailed clearly. Its not that worth it for a smaller link, if you really need it then just make the post/blog title be its ID instead. Saves space, easy to find anyways.
<br><br>
Lastly, whatever you do, do not remove the website tag behind it either. Removing that will just make it a random blog/post title/ID and then the image number which will also likely confuse you (even more so since its possible for posts to have similar or the exact same title/ID more often than not).
<br><br>
Its pretty easy to avoid, just don't do stupid shit basically. This probably isn't the most effective way of doing this stuff, but it means you can go through the list and everything will work as expected. Plus you can't expect much when trying to cut down on useless files so it will probably always cause issues lol. The reason we just did "Post-Media" is for other archives, but if you're willing to risk an extra folder than you might be able to manage anyways since its still cutting down a bit on the folders.
</details>
<br>
There is one last thing you can do which is Base64. I will warn you that you generally can't do much via this other than for really small files because extremely big files will just take forever to load and eventually not work at all. Either way, you should consider it if you have really really small files to archive (like 2kb per file at most if not less than 1kb files such as 32x32 tiles).
<br><br>
If you want to learn more about Base64, I would recommend checking out the essay I made on it. <a href="/Blogs/Essays/base64.html">Click here</a> for that blog, I explained what I learned so far doing Base64 via it. I actually do the DSi/3DSPaint art gallery with Base64 due to the amount of images otherwise there.
<br><br>
This will be the end of this essay, thanks for reading and I hope it has come in handy for you.

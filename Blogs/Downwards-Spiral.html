<div class=text>Welcome to <strike>hell</strike> the Downwards Spiral! Where hopes and dreams come to die (or should I say, empires instead really). This blog series is for how and why certain things fell off and sometimes how they can get back to where they once was.

Discord has been on a downwards spiral for years. I would argue it started going downhill since 2020 because before then it really wasn't as mainstream. It looked and acted like a mainstream website with the little restrictions of smaller websites. However in 2020 with the pandemic, more people started using Discord. And what had happened? Well it started going waaaaaaay downhill, all in just a few years.

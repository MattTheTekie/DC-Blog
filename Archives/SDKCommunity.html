<summary>A Fun Flipnote Time. | 6/9/2021 12:01 PM</summary>
So with my modded DSi, I was able to simply, have a, wonderful Flipnote time. Super nice to have easy to acess games and animation on the go.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Amazing homebrew stuff I guess | 7/2/2021 1:47 PM</summary>
Recently I modded more systems. And to think a few years ago I didn't even know this stuff existed. Time to go back to Prboom on 3DS.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Animating with annoyances xD | 7/3/2021 4:39 PM</summary>
Just been animating with Flipnote Studio 3D. One annoyance with my touch screen on 3DS and another since I am using a phone hotspot while letting my sibling put on some songs but they aren't good (to me anyways). One of the songs being Let it Go and another being Baby Shark. Other than that it's a fun Flipnote time.

<summary>Switch Stuf | 7/15/2021 11:18 PM</summary>
On switch you probably know about some of the best games on there. Super Smash Bros Ultimate, MK8+, Splatoon 2, Super Mario Maker 2, and Minecraft.
<br><br>
Minecraft is perfect obviously (or atleast legacy is but bedrock has more lag which sucks). SMM2 is great but would be cool to have costumes like on Wii U (R.I.P Wii U uploading 2015-2021). SSBU is nearly perfect but you can't upload videos directly from switch to youtube but you can save to micro sd then put the videos from the Extra folder onto Youtube and other places. MK8+ is similar except you can't even upload to YT anymore unlike the original on Wii U. Splatoon 2 is great just extremely laggy. The only issue across all these games is lag (which in most cases isn't the game itself now for these games just online).
</details>
<details>
<summary>Flashcart and CFW fun | 7/21/2021 4:43 PM</summary>
<p1>So around a month ago I got an R4 and in March of this year I modded a DSi XL. The two of these combined make a perfect combination. Especially if the flashcart has a 16gb micro sd card and the DSi has a 32GB SD Card (not micro).</p1>
<br><br>
<p1>Recently I played Mario Kart DS with cheats and it was great. I had a Big Luigi I could control. I can also dump GBA games on DS Phat/DS Lite (but I am having trouble with that as of now because even if I go to the folder its dumped in, I can't play the game).</p1>
<br><br>
<p1>Pretty much what I am saying is that it's great. Crazy to think that I never used these for many years up until now. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to mod systems.</p1>
<br><br>
<p1>Its way too easy now xD. Even I was able to mod 6 systems so far. Four being mine and 2 were my friends 3DSes).</p1>

<summary>3DSPaint on Wii U | 7/29/2021 4:15 PM</summary>
So right now I am typing this on Wii U. Yeah that doesn't make much sense to be using 3DSPaint on Wii U but hey why not :D
</details>
<details>
<summary>Another Blog I wrote on a stranger system. | 8/02/2021 1:50 AM</summary>
Yeah this time I decided to write on PS4. Doesn't make much sense even compared to Wii U but whatever. Nest I will probably get DS Lite Web Browser to write a blog on there. Well I'm out for now. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>A blog on 2nd gen Wii for some reason | 8/02/2021 7:13 PM</summary>
Idk why I said this is a good idea. Wii U kinda made sense with a touchscreen. PS4 is the newest great and reasonable option without DNS changing. But Wii makes no sense. Can't wait for a gamecube web browser to come out if it ever will.
<br><br>
Doesn't make sense. Just got a "little" bored. Well I'm out for now.

<summary>Painting on 3DS review | 8/14/2021 10:03 PM</summary>
This is a review of the ability to paint on 3DS/DSi via DSi/3DSPaint. It's good but on my "New" 3DS XL I have some issues. Touchscreen isn't the best but that is only on my 3DS. The main issue is that everytime I try to draw on 3DS it makes a line in a random direction. It also happens on DSi which doesn't otherwise have the issue. Kinda sucks due to that.
<br><br>
Overall I give DSi/3DSPaint's painting system a 7/10. Great except for that issue described earlier.

<summary>Top 5 Good Charlotte songs | 9/25/2021 6:32PM</summary>
Hello welcome back to my usele- uh I mean great blogs. Today I shall give my correct opinion about Good Charlotte songs I love. Well correct opinion isn't a thing but whatever. This will be least favorite to best. Tell me your favorites from Good Charlotte or other artists below.
<br><br>
1. The Anthem<br>
Yeah its good but overrated honestly. Other songs are better for sure.
<br><br>
2. Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous<br>
Much better in my opinion than The Anthem.
<br><br>
3. Girls and Boys<br>
No no the song has a point.
<br><br>
4. Little Things<br>
Right now this is one of my favorite Good Charlotte songs.
<br><br>
5. I don't wanna be in love (Dance Floor Anthem)<br>
Right now its da perfect song.

<summary>How to use Youtube on Wii U in 2021 (User Agent Method) | 10/1/2021 10:57PM</summary>
This will teach you how to use Youtube on Wii U with changing User Agents. This is one of the methods I found on GBATemp so not by me.
<br><br>
First type in https://m.youtube.com/persist_app=1&amp;app=m<br>
After click send then close the tab quickly<br>
Type youtube.com in and close the tab<br>
Change User Agent in Settings to Android<br>
Go to Youtube<br>
Watch videos :D
<br><br>
Part of this is needed so you can even load the website so as far as I know you can't directly change to Android on the User Agent settings and use it. The reason to not just use the app is because you can watch on the TV while doing something like using 3DSPaint. In fact as of the time of writing, I am on Wii U while watching Youtube so it's cool.
<br><br>
Where I found the method: https://gbatemp.net/threads/568873/<br>
Hope this is useful.<br>
PS - Runs mobile version only with ths method

Hello. Today I will teach you how to do math. If you hate math (like everyone else) then please leave now.

Subtraction: Same as adding but you remove stuff.<br>
Multiplication: More complex adding<br>
Division: Opposite of Multiplication.<br>

<summary>MK7/8 (Deluxe) Races | 10/10/2021 12:58 AM</summary>
I am wanting to race some people but obviously I am too lazy to add FCs. So my community code and tournament codes will be given instead.
<br><br>
MK7 Community: 54-1338-2075-7901<br>
MK8 Tournament: 1619-1416-8875
<br><br>
Have fun. MK8 will later be edited so you only have 30 min of downtime weekly instead of daily.

<summary>A blog on Switch | 10/10/2021 2:00 PM</summary>
Yep. Again I am doin this. Well i think I have a possible idea to make the site more active. SDK Community App for switch :D<br>
For the people who don't know there is an Iphone version of the site that exists. If possible legally I think it could be done even if difficult.
<br><br>
Well bye. From what I heard HullBreach was trying to become a Switch dev but I am not sure so it could be false. Well lets hope so.

<summary>N3DS/N2DS Video Upload Option | 10/29/2021 4:56 PM</summary>
Terms:<br>
N3DS/N2DS = New 3DS and New 2DS<br>
AVI = 3DS Video Format
<br><br>
Fun Fact: N3DS/N2DS can upload both videos and photos. What I think should be made is an option to upload AVI files on 3DS/2DS assuming it doesn't take too much space up to work. Something like a 3DSTube of sorts. How it is set out below.
<br><br>
Somewhat like normal YouTube but for N3DS.<br>
You can view, comment, and more probably in this section on 3DSPaint.<br>
You can also upload other N3DS compatible formats.<br>
It has a 1 week verification system so if there are few reports for 1 week then it is able to be randomly found like Hatena. If it is reported and reports are true then it is taken down. Otherwise, it is put up.<br>
If it hasn't been 1 week, you can view it still but you have to go to original posters profile to do so.<br>
You can upload MP4s, AVIs, and H264 files on 3DSPaint. SDKCommunity allows webMs and other files too.<br>
3 Videos Max Per day
<br><br>
Main issue I see other than spam is storage limits and making sure people know O3DS systems won't work with it. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to view most or all groups | 11/2/2021 9:32 PM</summary>
If you want to see all groups heres what you do.
<br><br>
1. Go to the address bar after going to the groups section<br>
2. Change the /?id=??? section to whatever number you like (0-99999 for example but there are much more)<br>
3. Find all the groups after submitting
<br><br>
It's surprisingly easy. Now I gotta find group 69 (it would be /?id=68 in this case due to 0-Whatever Number).<br>
Btw change the /?id=??? section to /?id=12703 for an example.<br>
Also some groups may be non-existent now.

<summary>A Basic Windows 10 Guide | 11/8/2021 12:10 AM</summary>
This is a Windows 10 Guide I will make.<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Recommended Storage<br>
At least 8gb of ram but preferably 16gb. Wait, you likely already know this basic stuff. Storage though is complicated. Just have a 256gb ssd instead of a big internal ssd. A hard drive that's 2-4TB is best in terms of price if you want multiple for a backup incase your main fails. If it's a PC that has a CD/DVD drive and it can read SD Cards or you get a SD Card reader, you can use that. If you're reading this and still go to school, you can use DVDs/CDs along with SD Cards to sell music for some cash. Well if people at your school don't know about yt5s.com when using adblock and they don't have spotify. Or if they are crazy like me and like to use stuff like their 3DS for music just because why not. Idk, do whatever you like. Also dump movies and make physical backups of your Steam games like Half-Life on CDs/DVDs if you want I guess.<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: The basic programs<br>
After installing Windows 10 and maybe making a Microsoft account, you should get certain things. Steam, Discord, Steam, Shotcut, and f.lux are essentials. Also you should have Oracle if you like VMs. Notepad++ is recommended too. Chrome or FireFox is also great. If you like doing something like watching movies or downloading YouTube videos to watch offline, download VLC Media Player. It's amazing.<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: Customization<br>
Pick a cool taskbar color and make sure to choose a cool background assuming you have a licensed Windows 10 install. If you don't care or you didn't pay for Windows 10, you can skip that part.<br>
As for Google Chrome, choose a cool theme. Also make sure your bookmarks are always shown because it is stupid to not show all bookmarks. If on Google Chrome, get Extensity, 'Improve YouTube', AdBlock, and Nook at least. There are likely more that are good but at least those. Extensity makes it easy to turn off extensions without uninstalling. Improve YouTube improves YT obviously. Nook allows you to easy listen to Animal Crossing Music. AdBlock, well, blocks ads.<br>
On Discord, NEVER TURN ON LIGHT MODE!!!! YOU WILL DIE IF YOU DO!!!! JUST DON'T TURN THAT ON.<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Best Websites<br>
These are the best websites to be used.<br>
<br>
coolmathgames.com (So cool it's better than 3DSPaint)<br>
3dspaint.com<br>
youtube.com<br>
subrock.rocks<br>
reddit.com<br>
rewrite.webs.nf (CloneMii+)<br>
bwitter.me<br>
gbatemp.net<br>
yt5s.com (Use AdBlock here to not accidently get viruses while downloading by lets say, clicking the fake download button)<br>
discord.com (Or use the PC Client)<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Best Games<br>
These are the best games on PC<br>
<br>
Minecraft (Non-Steam)<br>
Half-Life 1<br>
Terraria<br>
Trove<br>
Roblox (Non-Steam)<br>
Ultimate Doom<br>
Doom 2 + Master Levels<br>
Final Doom<br>
tModLauncher<br>
GZDoom (Non-Steam Mod for Doom Games)<br>
Team Fortress 2<br>
CS:GO<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Da Big Parts of the Internet<br>
You already know 3DSPaint and probably some other stuff if you are reading this. But try alternative sites like Bwitter and CloneMii+ too. They are pretty cool to check out.<br>
It is also a new thing to see if you didn't use some of these sites years ago (cough cough Late 2006 Twitter and 2013-2015 Web Site for Miiverse) or if you used it years ago, it's a nostalgia trip. Also take advantage of as many opportunities as possible for smaller sites. SpaceHey exists as well which is a mySpace clone based off an older design. It may help in the long run.<br>
YouTube and SubRocks are great. YouTube mainly for now. YouTube allows up to 20GB videos. Verify your account and start making videos. Do really whatever you like that doesn't break the rules.<br>
If you are lucky and can start getting your videos monetized, it may be useful to have a few extra dollars later down the line. Also with 85,000 different platforms, you can easily get more people. See what I am saying? It all feeds back into itself. Just please don't turn into a clickbait YouTuber. They are annoying.<br>
Maybe even have multiple accounts (you can have 50 channels in your google account lifetime which is cool). You can use this for lets say ??? Gaming, ??? Shorts, etc. YouTube mainly benefits as they literally don't stop you.<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Anti-Virus<br>
Just get something like Avast or actually be intelligent and don't pirate without being careful or at all. If you do pirate something like music, try to pirate by downloading MP3s of songs off of YouTube (see where yt5s.com comes in now). Also use AdBlock to be safer from viruses as you can run viruses from ADs if you aren't careful. Basically, be careful when doing suspicious stuff, or don't do anything more dangerous.<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: VMs<br>
You know how I said be careful or don't do dangerous stuff at all in Chapter 6? Yeah, mostly ignore that. VMs are most likely not going to get a virus and infect your computer. There are very few viruses that can attack the main computer from VMs. Still be careful, but it is better than 0 danger on your stuff. If you're IP gets leaked, you are still screwed though. VPNs should be used when doing something like the deep/dark web.<br>
<br>
Chapter 8: Emulators<br>
Are you a pirate or like playing enhanced versions of games? Get emulators. Dolphin (GCN/Wii), PCSX2 (PS2), snes9x (SNES), GEST (GB/GBC), and more are great. I don't promote piracy of games. Now you may wonder why music is here. Well, people just put it on Spotify or YouTube and with YT Premium, you can just download anything anyways. Might as well have no laws. Though still buy the music or use Spotify before using that please. YT5s can be used for more than music. Well now, I sound like a hypocrite but whatever. Basically, just buy stuff legit if you can, otherwise who cares if you pirate.<br>
<br>
Chapter 9: The end of this stuff<br>
You now have the basics you need. Maybe idk. Well let's see. After all, there is only one way to see if it works and that's to try it and see if it goes well. You can get other things too to make it even easier but whatever. This is basics.<br>
<br>
Chapter 10: Summary<br>
Install some basics<br>
Customize<br>
VMs are cool<br>
Don't Pirate<br>
Be careful<br>
Some Websites are basically Perfect or you have no other great alts to them.<br>
Play Good Games<br>
Give-up and go back to Wii U and 3D uh I mean PC Master Race is best life.<br>
Discord Light Mode Kills 7 People Daily.<br>
CoolMathGames is the best thing ever &gt;:D<br>
Make sure to have enough space on an external hard drive.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed this guide :D

So today I was in computer class like I do at 5th hour. At some point I guess people started talking about Trump/Joe Mam- uh I mean Biden and nearly the whole class started saying "Let's Go Brandon". I wanted to join along but in case the teacher said it was too loud, I didn't. Kinda funny that people randomly just started saying that.
<br><br>
In case I start a politics war over 2 old guys fighting for some stupid stuff, no I don't care about it. I just know what it means and it's funny to see some random kids not even 16 let alone 21 chant politics stuff and I wanted to share the story.
<br><br>
Hope you enjoyed the story. Might share more in new blogs or replies on this blog

<summary>Over 7 Years of being a Pokemon Trainer | 11/11/2021 11:28 PM</summary>
I started playing Pokemon when I was 6 in 2014 (it was mid-2014). First played Pokemon X on my now broken Gray N3DSXL. I took years to get more than 2 badges because I sucked. My username was Luigi back then. I loved the name Luigi. Infact, my NNID was called SuperFireLuigi1 which I still have. Then that same year, my dad handed down his copy of Pokemon Blue on Gameboy. This game was fun even though I still haven't beaten Gen 1. Around Christmas 2019, I started to get more interested in Pokemon again. Finally wanted to try to beat the game after remembering it. I made a new save file and picked my name. Little did I know, the name I picked then would be the base of a lot of names I would make on places like here. DCTheGamr for example was based off DC. But basically, I picked DC and beat the game in two weeks. After that was when I really wanted to play more.<br>
<br>
After I started to play more pokemon games. I had the VC of Blue in around 2016 along with Red too. While I still haven't beat them, I am close on my Yellow. Just need to beat Elite 4 and Champion now. That and maybe the 7th or 8th badge. Then in 2020 I had got a lot of Pokemon games for cheap. I got Omega Ruby, Platinum (2 but my main is fake though due to homebrew, I have a save backup), SoulSilver (fake), Sword (not a big fan), Sapphire, Colloseum, Battle Revolution, and more. Some were for Christmas, others were cheaper than usual. There are more like Ultra Sun and original sun. Though my favorite of them all is... POKEMON WHITE 2!<br>
<br>
It is near perfect for a Pokemon game. HGSS is the only one that is on the same level. BW2 manages to make everything just near perfect. Not many stupid mechanics (until competitive but they will always suck at that), animated 2D sprites that looks better in my opinion than whatever SwSh was, FREE ONLINE, all pokemon actually in-game (unlike other one I know of -&gt; SwSh), good story Pokemon wise, and more.<br>
<br>
My reviews of what I've played below:<br>
<br>
Pokemon Black/White 2<br>
Gameplay - Pretty standard. Better story though. The bad guys actually are somewhat scary other than 'Ya we stel pokamen evn tho yall du so 2 ther4 we evl'. It is broken a bit with Landorus T.<br>
Graphics - Glorious 2D Animation. Better than whatever SwSh is.<br>
Online - Free but somewhat easy to cheat. Also some things are broken now. Also Voice Chat.<br>
Pokemon - Above Gen 1 but worse than gens 3/4<br>
<br>
Pokemon HGSS<br>
Gameplay - Better than the original GSC though worse level curve.<br>
Graphics - 2D Sprites. Not animated too much unlike BW1 and BW2. Also fun fact; If you fail to catch a shiny pokemon with a pokeball it will re-sparkle before you can do anything again.<br>
Online - Free but requires WEP meaning I can't do so<br>
Pokemon - No entirely new ones here<br>
<br>
Pokemon Platinum<br>
Gameplay - Similar to Diamond/Pearl. It's literally enhanced but much, much faster. Surfing especially.<br>
Graphics/Online - Same as HGSS<br>
Pokemon - Most are great. Though they are mostly new evolutions. Legendaries, especially shiny Giratina Origin Form is perfection. Arceus is GOD now.<br>
<br>
Pokemon ORAS<br>
Gameplay - Similar to original Ruby/Sapphire. ALSO NO BATTLE FRONTIER. So many legendaries and more Megas. Mega Ray is broken. Primals ignored the normal 1 mega limit.<br>
Graphics - Same as XY<br>
Online - Basically perfect like XY<br>
Problem - They removed the ability to change clothes to make it 'more faithful' to the original.<br>
<br>
Pokemon X<br>
Gameplay - Somewhat easy especially now. Also, very few legendaries, only 4 those being box art, Zygarde, Mewtwo, and one of gen 1 birds. Megas were cool though.<br>
Graphics - First Full 3D Game. Great especially for future proofed models on 3DS and ok animations because it was only like 6 months after a 2D game.<br>
Online - XY was literally perfect.<br>
Problems - Not too good animations, way too easy, very few legendaries.<br>
<br>
I am too lazy to write the rest. These are the main ones. Sword and Shield would take forever anyways. Basically USUM/SM was fine but not a favorite and still kinda easy for me and SwSh was horrible. SwSh model lies, same animations, DLC that should have been free because of how bad it was before hand, horrible story, $60 + $30 before tax (even with 3rd versions it was normally $80 before tax), Pokemon Home was $16 dollars, and more. Basically, SwSh is one of the few Pokemon games I hate.<br>
<br>
Homebrew proves a lot of stuff as stupid. It isn't that much needed to store pokemon as they aren't even kilobytes. I can go to PKSM or Pokemon Chest and make a group with 500 Boxes of 30 pokemon for F R E E. No excuses. Also I can transfer forward AND backwards. Reminder: FOR FREE. Basically there's a lot of stupid stuff. No more GTS either except on mobile app. Technically it's free, but you can only have 30 Pokemon there. At least Pokemon Bank was cheap ($5 yearly).<br>
<br>
So basically, SwSh sucks while pre ORAS is near perfect. Gens 2-5 + XY are basically perfect in my opinion. Hope you enjoyed my blog. Now I will go play some games. And remember, Homebrew is always essential with 3DS/DS Pokemon Games.

<summary>CSS Profile/Group Template | 11/15/2021 11:25 PM</summary>
I have some CSS knowledge thanks to blueturtle teaching me. I have a basic template for you on your profile/group(s). So to have the basics I will explain it. Before I start though, note that blueturtle had taught me it when I needed help on my group and I will explain it.<br>
<br>
Give credits for the basic template to blueturtle. I am here to explain so if you are confused, you can get helped. I tested the group thing and with a few changes I was able to use it on my profile.<br>
<br>
Ok to start here is the template:<br>
<br>
*{background:black!important;border-color:gold!important;color:blue!important;}<br>
IMG[src="/images/logo.png"]{content:url(http://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/15245.jpg)!important;background-attachment:fixed!important;background-repeat:none!important;background-position:center!important;height:100px;width:300px;}
Body{background:url(http://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/15261.jpg)!important;background-attachment:fixed!important;}
:hover{color:crimson!important;}<br>
<br>
If you don't care what it looks like, just copy and paste it into the CSS box. To go to that you first click your profile picture. After you are in My Zone - Maintenance, you click Settings. Go down to Profile Styling (CSS). After you copy and paste this.<br>
<br>
Odds are you want to change it though. To do so is very easy. For the top part, you can change it from 3DSPaint to any image. First go to 3dspaint.com (not dsipaint.com or sdkcommunity.com), then you click on your profile.<br>
<br>
After that you click Image Uploads in My Zone - Maintenance.<br>
Then you click Choose File, choose a photo, name it, then check the hard to see box that says that you agree all images are yours and you have the right to upload them.<br>
<br>
Then you copy the link to said photo (i.e. http://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/15214.jpg). Do that by (on PC) dragging the photo to the search bar. If you can't do that you need another method.<br>
<br>
Take the first part of the example link (http://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/?????) and add the number after the "[FIGURE" in the photo uploaded success details. From there you copy the link into:<br>
<br>
{content:url(InsertLinkHere)!important;background-attachment:fixed!important;background-repeat:none!important;background-position:center!important;height:100px;width:300px;}<br>
<br>
You can easily change the size of it by changing "height:?px;width:?px" in the code. Height=How Tall and Width=How Long. Instead of height:100px;width:300px you can have height:50px;width:150px as an example. Pretty useful.<br>
<br>
You don't have to use 3DSPaint uploads and can do so in another place that does something similar to Image Uploads on 3DSPaint. Backgrounds are bigger so choose a slightly bigger photo if you want. Doing the Background is very similar but in a different location. Using the same methods, you copy and paste into:<br>
<br>
Body{background:url(LinkHerePlease)!important;background-attachment:fixed!important;}<br>
<br>
How to change text color:<br>
<br>
You can change text color by editing:<br>
<br>
*{background:black!important;border-color:gold!important;color:blue!important;}<br>
<br>
background:black is for the background color. You can change it to something like blue, green, purple, gold, etc.<br>
<br>
border-color:gold is for changing the border of the boxes surrounding things like the Biography, Badges, and Last Blogs.<br>
<br>
important;color:blue is the color of the text itself.<br>
<br>
:hover{color:crimson! is for the color of the text when you hover over stuff like the text and boxes.<br>
<br>
For every single one of them, you need to change the part where it says a color like gold with something else like crimson. That way, you will see different colors.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed this blog. If this was helpful than great :]<br>
<br>
I will be able to help you if you need help with CSS. blueturtle may also be able to help you but I don't know exactly when blueturtle is online. I am often online though because of how easily I always have access to the site and since my DMs are open, just DM me if needed on 3DS/DSiPaint. Or have fun and try yourself.<br>
<br>
Worst case you just clear all the code out as your profile settings don't affect the other parts of the site unless you copy and paste everything to every other group and user in the site. But that won't happen and even then you can just delete everything as I said previously. Basically, have fun and mess around with the template. It works on groups as well btw.
<blockquote>NOTE: Some CSS No Longer Works Due To * Being Patched. Thank You For Understanding</blockquote>

<summary>School World Discord Launch | 11/17/2021 9:29 PM</summary>
I made a Discord Server called School World. I could try to get the blog featured but I am not doing that if I even could because I know nobody wants to see a blog on a Discord server advertisement.<br>
<br>
School World Discord Server Stuff:<br>
<br>
Homework Help (If possible like Math)<br>
Family Friendly Memes<br>
Calming Music (See April 1st for Surprise)<br>
Advertisement Allowed in 1 chat<br>
Rule Breaker Chat (You got 3 warnings and Semi-Restricted yet didn't listen)<br>
Pokemon Battles/Trades + Showdown Hosts<br>
Other Games Like Minecraft<br>
Books/Comic Center (No more Library that hasn't been checked for years)<br>
Music<br>
Art and Animation (Same Chat)<br>
<br>
Did you break the rules or are you being falsely accused? We have a system where the case solvers and the rulers vote. I am working on a system to have a 'lawyer' that is a member who agrees to do that. Though due to stuff like carl-bot, it should be rarely needed.<br>
<br>
I have music playing when I can. It isn't perfect but is fun. I would do so by having it in the AFK channel but I can't do so sadly.<br>
<br>
If you are ever confused with homework, ask someone there. They might be able to help especially with math as that isn't easy to confuse the whole world with.<br>
<br>
Make music, art, books, and more. Play games, get school help (except tests), and have fun :D<br>
<br>
Hope you join the server. If you do then have fun : DD (I sure wish I could turn off auto-changing symbols into emojis as I hate it).<br>

<summary>Best Wii U Sites 2021 | 11/23/2021 11:09 PM</summary>
If you have a Wii U like me and know what the user agents do, you can visit a lot of sites. This is a list of the best. 10 of them to be exact. If you have a Wii U (or for some 3DS and even Wii/DSi) you can use these sites as of writing. This won't include 2 versions of the same site (3DS/DSiPaint) and instead only one which would be whatever is the better version.<br>
<br>
1. 3DSPaint (3dspaint.com)<br>
I'm writing on Wii U now. It even works on Wii despite the name. I don't need to explain anything here as you are reading on DSi/3DSPaint.<br>
<br>
2. Reddit (old.reddit.com)<br>
Old reddit works very good which isn't too surprising. If you don't know, reddit is pretty good. Updoots are basically likes and Downvotes are dislikes. Karma is how everything like that is determined. If more updoots then downvotes there is positive karma. If more downvotes, you lose karma. Theres messages and because its just an old version of a now modernized site that works with the new version, it is even better. It's basically one of the best sites on Wii U. Some people say Reddit and Twitter are equally as toxic but they forgot that you almost can't get cancelled on Reddit unlike Twitter where you get cancelled for the stupidest stuff.<br>
<br>
3. CloneMii+ (rewrite.webs.nf)<br>
This is a cool Miiverse clone. Other than the homebrew Rverse, its the most active clone in 2021. Also me (DC TheGamr), holds the 3000th post there so I own da world &gt;:D<br>
<br>
4. Bwitter (bwitter.me)<br>
This is a late 2006 Twitter clone except you have a 300 character bweet limit. It even works on DSi so try it if you want!!! Basically old twitter but better (also better than modern twitter obviously). Not much to say here.<br>
<br>
5. YouTube (youtube.com)<br>
In 2020 it wasn't possible to use the site anymore. Yet User Agent as usual gives a middlefinger to that. Basically there is a blog I made that explains this. However, essentially you can just change user agents to allow yourself to use it again. You can do this while browsing other stuff and it works well unlike the app. Highly recommend it.<br>
<br>
6. Gmail (mail.google.com)<br>
You can check your gmail with the HTML version. If you have a job imagine saying 'sorry my phone and pc are broken so i need to check my email on wii u'. Kinda funny you can even do this. Btw it works on 3DS too.<br>
<br>
7. GBATemp (gbatemp.net)<br>
It barely works but it does. Somehow loads on 3DS too. Very useful for stuff like Homebrew help. Try it :D<br>
<br>
8. Playboxie (playboxie.com)<br>
It has free games to play on the web browser via HTML5. Very fun every once in a while.<br>
<br>
9. Pear (mineweb.42web.io)<br>
This is a Miiverse alternative that looks like Wii U miiverse. Very cool.<br>
<br>
10. Colors Gallery (colorslive.com)<br>
This is the gallery for Colors 3D and Colors Live along with the mobile app but the website. Lots of art and replays.<br>
<br>
These are all of the sites I consider the best. Though I also barely got the list finished. Honorable mentions are Biiverse and Sudomemo. Misdew is probably good too though :D<br>
You can tell me more sites in the comments.
<blockquote>So turns out Reddit isn't as good as Twitter in the future. 2022 Twitter is better than Reddit now. Thank you Elon.</blockquote>

<summary>Closest Ways to Get YouTube on O3DS/O2DS | 11/27/2021 4:05 PM</summary>
This guide is for people who want entertainment on O3DS/O2DS. YouTube, Netflix, and other apps are all gone. To do this, you need 2 games. A gen 6 or 7 pokemon game and Super Smash Bros For 3DS (SSB4). You also should download Swapdoodle and Flipnote Studio 3D. This stuff is the basis. You may need a bigger SD Card as well btw.<br>
<br>
1. Pokemon<br>
In pokemon there is the VS Recorder. Gen 6/7 Pokemon games allow 100 battles per game to be saved. You can upload them all. With others codes, you can also view their battles. With Gen 4/5 its even easier. Very cool<br>
<br>
2. SSB4<br>
This game allows replays. You can save 64 (or on Wii U over 200). You can upload, view, and (at least 3DS) download too. You also have lots of songs you can listen to with headphones which is cool. Unlike Brawl, replays can be 10 minutes long. Very cool xD<br>
<br>
3. Swapdoodle<br>
Its a message client for 3DS. Doesn't make sense to be here right? Wrong, messages get drawn when viewed. 4 Pages worth at most. Then 100 replies at most. That is a lot. Each note could have 104 pages as a result. Its free to so download from E-shop and give it a try :D<br>
<br>
4. Flipnote Studio 3D<br>
This is an animation software for 3DS. If you have access to homebrew and a computer, make sure to install Kaeru Gallery to share Flipnotes easily. Highly recommend getting. You need to go to MyNintendo to get it. If you can't do that I can help get a download code for you.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps. Flipnote Studio 3D and SSB4 are probably the best for YouTube alternatives.

<summary>Things Done that Suck but are Occasionally Done for Fun | 12/2/2021 9:48 PM</summary>
This is a list of things that we do sometimes for fun despite having no reason thats good to do so. Hope you like the list :D<br>
<br>
1. Listening to Songs Like The Real Slim Shady Censored<br>
This is kinda fun if you are really bored especially with My Name Is, Guilty Conscious, and Without Me. My Name Is was censored so badly it is kinda funny. Guilty Conscious is funny with both versions surprisingly. Listen to both censored and uncensored to see. Without Me barely changes majorly.<br>
<br>
2. Follow the Laws in GTA<br>
This one is obvious. The one time where no crime is more interesting.<br>
<br>
3. Spam<br>
Who doesn't like saying EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE in their 3DS/DSiPaint group(s)? I love it. Same for in Discord. Very fun, highly recommend trying in a spam chat or server you own.<br>
<br>
4. Using Useless Homebrew<br>
This is fun. You Are An Idiot Fan-Made Homebrew, Button Count, ThirdTube only on N3DS defeating it's entire purpose other than stuff like comments (and maybe now YouTube dislikes), and more likely. I like useless stuff after all.<br>
<br>
5. Playing Stupid Games<br>
Lady in a Leotard With a Gun and N3DS Mario Game Secret come to mind with this along with homebrew. It's very fun.<br>
<br>
6. Using Useless Sites<br>
There are basically dead sites like Pear (see blog on cool Wii U sites) that are fun to use (and troll/spam :D). I love it. Another example is Biiverse (basically dead but kinda active).<br>
<br>
This was the list of things done that suck but are occasionally done for fun. Hope you enjoyed it. Wouldn't mind adding more later if you say some in the comments.

<summary>Email Clients that work on 3DS | 12/04/2021 11:11 AM</summary>
You are looking for an email client or just want to read this. There are a decent amount of clients that work. This is a list and how to for each I have found. Note: I only have N3DSXL and not O3DS
<br><br>
1. Gmail<br>
This is likely the best. You can either use the HTML desktop version or Mobile version. The mobile version is the most neat and has both file uploads (HTML Desktop too) and drawing (Mobile only). If on N3DS, you even can upload videos.
<br><br>
2. Outlook<br>
This is common and easy to get working. It likely only works on N3DS as I had issues even with "New" models. First, load outlook.com as mobile. After signing in (or up), you wait for it to run out of memory, don't reload and then switch off mobile requests. Now you get an older version of it.
<br><br>
3. Yahoo<br>
This is easy to use and it's trusted too. That's why I put it here.
<br><br>
4. Yandex<br>
This seems to work on O3DS which is cool. It's likely rare to find an email client like this so enjoy.
<br><br>
These are some email clients that work well. Hope this was helpful. I randomly actually have Blog ideas randomly now. Well, I will go do something now.
<blockquote>Some of these no longer work on N3DS either no matter what you try (or I'm unlucky).</blockquote>

<summary>How to Make an Unblocked Video Site for School Easily | 12/4/2021 11:24 PM</summary>
This guide is so you can be nearly as cool as the coolmathgames creator(s). You will never be as cool as them but you can be close.<br>
<br>
1. Make Google Site or Slide<br>
2. Make a simple site (if you want add multiple pages). If using slides, make lots of pages.<br>
3. Put YouTube Embeds or upload to Drive then put videos there after making the video publicly downloadable.<br>
4. Publish<br>
<br>
Yep it's that simple. Below isn't needed but recommended.<br>
<br>
1. Make more google accounts (free 15GB each)<br>
2. Have friends help a bit (they can have multiple accounts too)<br>
3. Use YT Embeds to your advantage. You can have 20GB Videos and upload 2000 in a single day in theory. After that, you can only upload 50 daily but that's still a lot. 4 Accounts Ã— 50 channels each = 200 YT channels at least for you only.  That means before you reach 2k uploads per channel, you will have 400,000 videos. Theres so much you can do that it works out better than expected.<br>
4. Allow trusted people like me to help. I have a few accounts so if you want a SchoolTube site then DM here so I can help. I would be able to help get 60GB of videos before considering YT Embeds.<br>
<br>
I hope this helped you. Enjoy ignoring school limits :D

<summary>My Concerns for the Future of the SDK Community | 12/10/2021 11:07 PM</summary>
There are a decent bit of concerns I have for both versions of this site (sdkcommunity.com is useless unless it gets updated and allows signing in). Here is a list of them.<br>
<br>
1. The Site Population<br>
From what it seems, the site was decently active until around 2019-2020. Then lots of people seemed to quit the site or aren't active other than coming on every 3 months or longer. I'll take a guess and say there are around 30 people at least online every once in a while. HullBreach is likely very active (it's his site after all). Me, Weeeheep, Itzako, royal-rawr, kand blueturtle seem to be close in terms of activity. Draconid_Jo is likely to be much more active when his 2DS is fixed (see his blogs for context). There 2 other people active but I can't remember the names (saw their birthdays). I may be incorrect (and by maybe I mean am likely wrong and there is more). Rlad116 and a few others are decently active. In total, probably like 11-15 at least decently active people. I doubt this is accurate and it could be something like 100 but still. That is not too good. In a few years, it may be possible to have 11-15 people here at best if lucky. It is seemly only the few OGs, around 6-7 people actually new, and probably only 2 or 3 returning members odds are. There may be a way to get more people here but it's kinda dead as of now until night (except weekends where everyone is active not surprisingly). This is the main concern.<br>
<br>
2. Lack of Bigger Updates or New Games/Apps<br>
There isn't much new stuff. I'm thinking we could gave a DSiTube on DSi which allows gifs to be uploaded. Gifs are much smaller than actual video so this would be easy to have a rating/comment system and 500x500 gifs. It could be cool tbh. Though sdkcommunity.com (or 3DSPaint having videos) would be cool. If we had a limit of like 100MB, it may be possible. A few TB would probably be good (4TB hard drives could even be good due to how small the community is especially since some people mainly use DSiPaint) as a 100MB video limit isn't too small. Also maybe forcing MP4 or MKV would be fine. It's pretty cool. I at least hope that SDKCommunity gets an update like this. Also, fix painting on 3DSPaint for 3DS if you can while you are at it. The main concern with the video/gif uploading service is copyright issues and (videos basically) storage. Ping-Pong with friends could be cool. Also, Internet Archive reveals active DS games with online so I think that it should be brought back sine Wimmifi exists (i,e. 1 highly active Wii Game or 3 so its more than Mkwii and brawl and 2 highly active DS games). Maybe 3DSPaint could have 3DS/Wii U instead. All switch games seem extremely active so who cares. SDKCommunity could have PC, Switch, PS4, and Xbox games that are very active (3 each). More control over groups could be cool along with a chatroom like Discord (except it clears easily if you want to delete stuff). Also make the inbox system not burn my eyes off plz bc yellow bad there.<br>
<br>
3. Discontinuation of Old Services like Nintendo Network + Gamertag Conveniences<br>
Some may know Pretendo Network is out for public Wii U beta. Eventually tho, NNIDs will be useless outside of redownloading. I'd assume it just gets replaced by saying your PNID instead. However tho, I think we could add more. Xbox Gamertags, PSN Usernames, Steam name, PNIDs, Switch FCs, 3DS FCs, and for now NNIDs should all be there. It makes the most sense for now. Maybe Discords too.<br>
<br>
4. Survival of the Site in General<br>
As HullBreach said in one of his blogs, he has to pay $60 out of pocket. Odds are, it's good for now (but reducing the cost more would be useful a bit especially if somehow we get to a point where money is made or ads + patreon covers most of $60). Eventually though, more people may leave. Some people may join too but not many by now. Also, without enough money to maintain easily, we'd either become google 2, put heavy ads, start removing lots of old stuff, or even shutdown. Luckily you can donate but even so, there are some people who can't do that really. There may be a good alternative for some things like videos (i.e. help host part of 3DSPaint/DSiPaint for your uploads/friends) which may cut things down. I do have access to a decent bit of storage for some things. Also, we could use a YouTube channel that some people share (HullBreach, Admins, and Video mods). YouTube can easily be exploited as there are high limits. 20GB vids, 2000 without limit, and even after 2k uploads, 50 uploads daily. It would be easy to do whatever we like with 5 YT channels for vids. Just limit most people to 2 uploads daily (or for everyone moderating/partners 5 daily). We can really take advantage of things like YT.<br>
<br>
Well. These are all concerns and some solutions. If theres any thing you want to explain or something you have as criticism/extra options then tell me in the comments.<br>

<blockquote>So this blog was completely shit. Most of it doesn't even make sense looking back on it, but I assume the point about HB becoming switch dev helps SDK was that if he made money from it, it would help 3DSPaint/DSiPaint and as a result help the community. Idk I wonder if I watched youtube kids before this because it would look like it. </blockquote>

<summary>Why Emulation is Important | 12/19/2021 6:44 PM</summary>
Emulation is pretty important in video game history. There are probably 100s of games that would either be more expensive or lost to time without emulation. SNES Satellaview games would basically not be playable unless you were rich OR with emulation. It saves a lot.<br>
<br>
1. Rarity of Games<br>
There are so many games that are already expensive. Pokemon HGSS are sometimes up to 200 dollars along with Pokemon BW2. If you don't have a DS, DSi, or 3DS/2DS, the best option is emulation. Much more reasonable. Of course, don't pirate (especially if it's easy to get a game), but you can dump a game legitimately. Also, dumping allows you to have a backup in case your cartridge breaks.<br>
<br>
2. Better Graphics<br>
So many games suck without good graphics. Imagine GTA San Andreas with actually good graphics and the original music via simply rendering at a higher resolution. That is what you can do with PS2 emulation. Original Music, Better Graphics, Fewer Crashes, and better controls. It is literally all better in this case.<br>
<br>
3. Ease of Installing Mods<br>
If you have a favorite game such as Pokemon, emulation may allow playing the custom game. Odds are I could play Pokemon Blaze Black 2 or Newer Super Mario Bros DS on Wii U and PC. This advantage is just a PC thing in general too.<br>
<br>
4. PRESERVATION<br>
This is the main point. SO MANY GAMES ARE HARD TO FIND. Some are still lost to time even with more modern tools. Most, if not all 3DS/DS games along with Wii U and Wii games are likely fine, but games from let's say the N64 could have easily been lost. Luckily, due to emulation, we can easily play those games. Emulation is pretty important<br>
<br>
Well yeah, emulators are gud. Just so you know, I don't want piracy. While emulators are good, piracy should not be done. Just because you can use Wii U USB Helper to get nearly every Wii U game ever doesn't mean you should. Those games (mostly) deserve actually being paid for. If the copyright owners don't say multiple times that you are ok to pirate it, don't. This isn't 4th grade with an R4 card pretending you are the coolest kid ever. You likely won't get arrested since the FBI isn't out to get the 12 year old who pirated Animal Crossing Plaza for Wii U, but it's still illegal.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed :]
<blockquote>Can't give roms but emulation is based so do it if you can hack your consoles or have a PC. </blockquote>

<summary>How was your christmas everyone? | 12/27/2021 1:01 AM</summary>
Hello all 3DSPaint users. How did your Christmas go (Eve and Christmas Day)? Mine went very well. Got a lot of stuff like Monster Hunter PS2, SNES Classic, etc. Very good :]

<summary>New Years Soon + Things I Want to Do | 12/31/2021 10:53 PM</summary>
As you know soon, it will be the 3rd chapter of 2020. Letâ€™s figure out things we hope to do but wonâ€™t do at all or even attempt to do. Some things I plan to do below.<br>
<br>
1. Learn more programming languages:<br>
Some examples are Java Script, C++, Php, etc. Java Script would be good for games on sites I will make. C++ (along with others), can be used for games installed on PC. PHP is what I will likely use for InternetLand though I will likely go from using Neocities to something like Cloudflare or AWS and get a regular web domain.<br>
<br>
2. Make better art/animations:<br>
This one is simple. I want to learn animation more. Maybe also some music on the side as I do have a piano now.<br>
<br>
3. Continue establishing myself on the internet:<br>
Also pretty simple. Itâ€™s pretty fun tbh. Improve my groups (3DSPaint, SpaceHey, Reddit, etc) as one example.<br>
<br>
4. Take over the universe<br>
Number 69420, DC takes over the world. He was once a troll on the internet but accidentally took over the whole world when he sent a random meme. He now owns the world which is cool.<br>
<br>
These are things I wanna do in 2022. This is a small version of around my 4 highest current priorities other than a kinda joking one. Thanks for reading. Depending on how long it takes to be featured if it is at all, it could be 2022. In fact, even at submission time it may be 2022 thanks to time zones. Tell me what some things you want to do in 2022 are.
<blockquote>So which of these things did I do since its 1y or older as of you reading? Well...
<br><br>
2, 3, and 4. Yes the most useless of the two with 1 soon going to happen in 2023 (aka JS). What a shock that I didn't do them. Its as if no one does lol. </blockquote>

<summary>SDK Community Guide | 1/4/2022 1:33 AM</summary>
Welcome to the SDK Community. It's pretty small but still big enough for me to find 27 members before counting admins, HullBreach, and his wife which could bump that to around 40. Plus, there may be some I'm missing. Basically, small. I will teach you all the tricks I know of this site. I will assume you are a stupid 11 year old for stuff like basics.<br>
-------------<br>
The Basics of DSi/3DSPaint:<br>
If you aren't verified, wait a day or two. They say an email will be sent, but that doesn't work. It's F A L S E. You gotta wait unless it get's fixed. If you are verified, congrats! The real fun begins. Someone like me may greet you. If it's me, expect a friend request and constant spamming until you join my Empire (jk). Maybe write a blog or two and make a horrible painting. Also, make a group and worship Waffle King (if you want) who is easy to find as he has the most popular group on the site. An explanation of each thing to an extent below.<br>
<br>
3D Photo Gallery: 3DSPaint exclusive. Upload your 3D photos.<br>
Paint: You can make bad drawings or if on PC, actually decent ones. DSi is also ok with this.<br>
Blogs: Blog about stuff or by this point, most activity other than groups is here. Guides, Poetry/Lyrics, etc.<br>
Bulletin Boards: Probably the 3rd closest to actually talking with a decent number of people.<br>
Chatrooms: Pretty obvious in the name. Group shoutboxes have replaced them for the most part now.<br>
Games: Chaos, Stupid, Gambling, and Megic. Basically, Savii Slots is the best.<br>
Groups: The main way of interaction. Make a group and join groups. Most notifications will be about group shoutboxes. Best thing on the site along with Blogs.<br>
Help Desk: Help on the site and suggestions.<br>
Library: Blogs are what is used for it by this point.<br>
Polls: Ask stuff and get everyone to agree on 1-2 things.<br>
Saviis: Basically useless now other than for 1 avatar.<br>
DMs: Message Friends Directly<br>
Extra Stuff: Other sites, patreons, etc. Most of y'all don't care.<br>
<br>
To write a good blog you need good grammar, some good topic, and a decent explanation of it. Groups can be as basic as no CSS though I'll explain groups a bit more later. Bulletin Boards are just you talking about a specfic topic. Some are gaming and web design. Polls you basically ask questions. Chatrooms can be fun with others but basically there are over 8 and you can change the color of your name. If you want to talk about something to one person, use DMs in your zone. You have a profile that you can have css and multiple pages. Also stuff like your first name, b-day, NNID/FCs, and a Bio. Go to dark mode instantly for the sake of your eyes and give yourself a cool signature (and by that I mean an inspirational quote from a "deep" 14 year old). To friend a person or block them, go to their profile and either click block (to block) or click request (to friend).<br>
-------------<br>
Customization Options:<br>
<br>
-Blogs<br>
You can use BBCodes on Blogs. There are a lot. I will go over the main 4 but for all, click this link which is in FAQs.<br>
<br>
[a=] [/a] - Hotlink things. I didn't use regular a for the first to prevent activating. Tip: If it's a link on this site (like a blog), remove the http://sdksite.com part (not anything past that including /). If done right, you should be able to link a blog on DSiPaint while a 3DSPaint user will still be on 3DSPaint and vice versa.<br>
<br>
[color=] [/color] - Change text color. This is how I have custom colors in the blog. CSS may overwrite this as a warning.<br>
<br>
[FIGURE #] - Shows an image uploaded via Image Uploads on 3DSPaint.<br>
<br>
[spoiler=titleherexD] [/spoiler] - Great for keeping this from taking up so much space upon loading and game spoilers. Make sure to use a normal e to use this.<br>
<br>
-Groups/Profiles<br>
Groups have CSS and pages. Noice. They also support BBCodes as seen above in Blogs.<br>
<br>
Pages - You can have pages with stuff like info. For an example, go see this link right here by clicking this text. Spoilers are important here btw. Nice to make things look neater at first before clicking buttons.<br>
<br>
CSS - This is very complicated. It is enough to make an entire blog. In fact, I have done a blog that you can view right here with this link. The blog linked is also long like this one.<br>
-------------<br>
The SDK Community:<br>
The community is very peaceful. In fact, the only group with wars is my empire (ironically bc I claim it's the best group). Some cool people/groups below.<br>
<br>
- Groups<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221219033712/https://3dspaint.com/group/?id=9347">Official Waffle King Fan Kingdom</a><br>

and more as it would take forever to list<br>
<br>
This community is very peaceful and unlike others as of now. Basically perfection. Now to be fair, there are like 40 people left, but it's still great.<br>
-------------<br>
Hope this blog was useful. One last thing, there are rating systems on blogs. One is for family friendly ratings (RP-M) and another with a like and dislike system. Very convenient. If you want me to explain more, I can try to help. Have fun in the SDK Community now.

<summary>Why the SDK Community App Should Be Updated | 1/7/2022 5:05 AM</summary>
So, some of you may know about the SDK Community App for iOS. There are a lot of problems making it suck. For a site -&gt; app conversion, no CSS is sad though ok because that would be hard to work out I bet, but the major problem is how broken some things are. It works surprisingly well and may be useful for the basics, but that's it. BASICS. Below are things that need to work.<br>
-----------<br>
1. Blogs<br>
Blogs are kinda broken. It isn't exactly broken, more so a thing about how long it takes to get blogs featured. If it was a few years ago supposedly, it would be very fast and I bet 14 days was fine when the app was originally created. However now, that only shows 4 blogs, one of which was a bumped blog on Dec 27, 2021. The other 3 are this year. So basically, the only way we could have reasonable numbers of blogs here is if we are to mass create absolute horrible stuff. Your blogs also works, but you don't care about your own blogs so much that you re-read them 100s of times on these sites of all places (DSiPaint/3DSPaint). Also, it would be cool to actually be able to write blogs on the app. If we do not get around 90 days back for blogs, I say we should have all blogs including non featured ones though I think that would be hard. Image below for the absurdity that is only 4 blogs. Basically, allow up to 90 days back for blogs and being able to write blogs on the app.<br>
<br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100150_1.jpg">
<br><br>
2. Groups<br>
Groups are way less broken then blogs (though I am also in over 10 groups). Even so, it still kinda sucks. For example, links don't show properly and since I linked stuff with [a] on 3DSPaint, it looks weird. Also, spoilers and color doesn't work. That kinda sucks. To be fair, it works decently well other than the shoutbox needing to allow deletion of messages (in case you want to like me wanting to have 1 message by each member at the end for some reason in my Empire).<br>
<br>
3. Painting<br>
Literally does not work. I can't even save a blank page. Can we at least fix that plz? Blogs wouldn't be an issue if there were actually more than 2 blogs weekly to read while Groups only have minor things that affect it. Painting could be fixed right? Though fr, it doesn't work at all. Well the top 100 paintings work here luckily too. Though painting something is more fun (so much so, it's even part of DSiPaint's and 3DSPaint's name).<br>
<br>
Minor Complaints:<br>
You can't make an account on the app (which is pretty stupid for most people after already also having to wait a whole day because the email system still doesn't work as of now). Also, when viewing the info for why the SDK Community is called the SDK Community, it sometimes gets stuck and is hard to fix without exiting the app, but this is minor<br>
<br>
To be fair:<br>
To be fair, the vast majority of things work. I am honestly impressed that an app that hasn't been updated in probably forever still works this good (even though this site is working on PHP backend and redesigning the whole site would be impossible). Below is an image of messages working well:<br>
<br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100150_2.jpg">
<br><br>
Stuff That Should Be Added:<br>
<br>
1. Image Uploads<br>
2. Account Creation there (if possible, even bypass the wait if people can't use it to make spam bots and they have valid emails).<br>
3. Ability to Delete Chat Messages in Group Shoutbox (if you own the group).<br>
4. Make the links not look so weird by using it.<br>
5. Add stuff like the Bulletin Boards and Library.<br>
6. Allow Changing of things like your email and password. Maybe even add an exclusive option to have a phone number as a way to recover your account if you want to.<br>
7. Allow visiting of your/others profile and allow editing of yours including pages (just without the whole CSS thing).<br>
8. Finally start allowing image uploads for PFP directly there. People have gotten around this non-existent since 2011 thanks to 3DS issue a long time ago so we should just have it here if no where else. The only issue with this one is spam (but that is already a problem exploiting the DSi paint gallery).<br>
-----------<br>
My Small Little Extra Paragraphs:<br>
<br>
Honestly, I think it is reasonable to have this list as a list of things that should be added. At least the first few points along with Image Uploads and Bulletin Boards + visiting people's profiles/editing your own. I am ok with CSS being unavailable on the SDK Community App. Even then, I think that if we did this, it may be somewhat useful. I do know that most people probably forgot about this site (partly because it was always small and with people leaving, there is less reason to be here and therefore, more leaving), but some probably forgot it existed too. If SDK Community had like an app on your phone, it would be so easy to remember it exists as it is likely right next to all your other apps.<br>
<br>
This is definitely the case for people like me who have folders to sort this stuff. Very convenient. Even now with Shortcut manipulation on iOS and probably something similar on Android, it still seems suspicious at first (some people on discord asked multiple times if I was sure it wasn't a broken 90s site and I had to reassure them it was safe and show that I did it myself to prove it xD) and then the wait too makes more people probably give up eventually. For a dead site like this I bet they wouldn't even pay attention and then just think that the email is just waiting to be sent when in reality, it wouldn't work and after that, they are like "I'll check later" and then forget.<br>
<br>
Of course, most people don't forget that easily but even so, it still sucks. What's even more annoying is when you showed a friend the site and it was likely marked as a spam bot so the account was closed despite actually being a friend which seemly happened with @nosaints457 I think. But basically, that's what I think needs to be in the SDK Community App and it could be very useful. Now I think this would take a long time, but is 100% possible.<br>

<summary>DC Blog Adventures | 1/09/2022 3:12 AM</summary>
Hello. Welcome to the first DC Blog Adventures Game. This is a cave with games and other stuff. Normally I allow comments, but I will make it harder for you to cheat by disabling them. There are 8 main quests along with side stuff and a final extra quest. After the first blog, you are free to go in any direction including the final thing but that isn't recommended as it will be more hard that way. Have fun. Also, jk about the comments. You can comment but plz no cheats<br>
------------<br>
Beginner's Tips:<br>
There are confusing parts of this game. For example, if you die you are killed. Drink water to stay hydrated. OverlorDS is boring as hell.

<summary>What Happened to blueturtle? | 1/11/2022 12:28 AM</summary>
So recently, you may have noticed that @blueturtle got his SDK Community account disabled. I do know he wasn't banned luckily. So what happened? I have 5 guesses on what happened.
<br><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100157_1.jpg">
<br><br>
As you can tell by this image, he wasn't banned as @GuiedGui checked. Even then, it says that blueturtle disabled his account. Read Below for what I think.<br>
----------------<br>
1. He is leaving 3DSPaint<br>
This one is worst case scenario. He decided to quit the SDK Community. He is probably in the SDK Community Discord Server luckily. I can check there when I feel like it.<br>
<br>
2. He was hacked<br>
This is a possible option. If he was hacked, it would make the most sense. After all a password hack, email steal (in which they also stole that account), or something else may have done that. I believe this is the most likely. It is highly likely honestly. There is another possible option.
<br><br>
3. Someone in his family disabled it<br>
This is also possible. Depending on the age and if his parents are not wanting him on there, they may have disabled after finding out. You may ask "how did they get in" and to that I say, they may have still been logged in or they may have forced him to give up the username and password and disabled it.
<br><br>
4. He is an idiot<br>
Pretty simple. He "accidently" disabled it by being an idiot. This is also possible.<br>
----------------<br>
As to how long, if any time, he has to re-enable his account is unknown to me. I will say around 30 days though. It doesn't make sense honestly. @blueturtle is one of the highest of the users here (other than @jsa005, @GuiedGui, admins/@HullBreach, and @Draconid_Jo + @Tora-Kokoro tho), however I guess any user still here is very high up in terms of importance. Either way, it kinda sucks.
<br><br>
I definitely hope he comes back. Due to it not being a ban, it doesn't make sense. He was a CSS God. He taught me and others CSS. I even gave him the name "CSS God" in my group. I hope this isn't how he disappears. While he was a little annoying at times, he was a good member.
<br><br>
Also, Horror Stories and Afterlife were amazing groups. They still exist, but made by an "inactive member". If he is gone, that is one guy gone. From like 35 to 34. Luckily, this site basically had a whole rebirth with people like me and @Itzako this year, so we have hope.<br>
----------------<br>
Edit: @blueturtle is no longer able to be seen sadly<br>
Edit 2: I am an idiot. Still can be seen. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210517122259/https://3dspaint.com/member/?id=149433">Here is the link again lol</a>

<summary>DC Blog Adventure 1: Quest 1 | 1/15/2022 2:08 PM</summary>
In da beginning, there was a god named DC. He created the universe by saying "create light plz I hate the bright light but it doesn't have to be that dark". From then on, there was light.
<br><br>
After that, many years passed then SDKit was made. Little did the people know, it would revolutionize the world. It could take it over in an instant. And thats what it did. There were other empires but nobody could compete. SDKit was superior to all other empires. There was the BanPainter guy, but he sucked. Only Pancake King could compete and even then, he wasn't close.
<br><br>
By this point, you may wonder "Who started the empire though" and to that I say, nobody remembers. There are rumors. Some say DC himself. Others say xXCoolGamr148Xx did so. Whatever the case is, no one knows exactly who did it. Maybe it will be found one day...<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
In Da 1550s:
<br><br>
GenericGuy43: Hello Flipn0teCritakI, I am here to try to settle something before a war happens. I have an offer for you. If you give me 13.2% of your land, I will not start war with you. If you don't listen, a war WILL HAPPEN!!! SO IF YOU DON'T WANT A WAR TO HAPPEN, GIVE ME 13.2% OF YOUR LAND!!!<br>
Flipn0teCritakI: Eh no. Too much land.<br>
GenericGuy43: One last chance Flipn0teCritakI, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THISSSSS!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?<br>
Flipn0teCritakI: Yeah I am sure<br>
GenericGuy43: Well then, from this moment on I am going to engage in war with you until you give me that land.<br>

<summary>Why Microsoft Email Recovery Sucks | 1/19/2022 12:43 PM</summary>
So recently I needed to recover an old email of mine. It was made on a microsoft infrastructure so I had to go the microsoft way. I won't say if it's msn, live, hotmail, or outlook but basically I had to recover it. Since I had an Xbox, used email services, and knew a few other things, I figured it wouldn't be hard. I also have a windows computer so it shouldn't be too hard right?
<br><br>
Well no. I tried the windows hello thing as I set it up when I had seemly been hacked and didn't work. Even tho I put in my pin, they suck so yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. Didn't work.
<br><br>
I went to the email sign in and typed what I then remembered as my password. It then said "suspicious activity" so I guess I used a VPN to sign in without remembering its on (idk exactly what but probably chrome web browser). Another problem, I didn't have an alt email available there and my old phone number I didn't have either otherwise this blog wouldn't exist. So I put in the email, alt email, and other stuff like that. I then got an email for the code seen below.
<br><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100165_1.jpg">
<br><br>
I then inputted other stuff like name used on the account, birthday (from what I think bc idk if I lied about age when creation or not). Then it got to the other part that really should be instant recovery assuming the Xbox Live device ID isn't done in a stupid way. Image below
<br><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100165_2.jpg">
<br><br>
As you can see, you input your Xbox Gamertag (pretty reasonable) and Xbox Live (now network) device ID. You would think if you had both your gamertag and XBL Device ID, it would be easy to recover right? Nope. Unless it was the email I used (didn't have my real name xD) that was the breaking cause of the suspicion. Well no. I actually just did the recovery process as of typing and they said it didn't work again despite the email being more similar to my real name. Just yaaaaaaaaaay.
<br><br>
So I am locked out of my email and can't do a lot still. Just fun as you can imagine. Strange thing is that this didn't happen for most other services. Google didn't have a problem (and we all know how much they love being annoying), Steam wasn't too hard, Discord was easy, PSN worked, Nintendo didn't have the issue, and GBATemp was really easy. There are probably some I am missing though. Roblox won't change without password but at least it makes sense here as it is a kids site, Reddit won't work (even though I have google linked so it should work as it automatically puts whatever your google or apple email is when creation if done like that), and of course, Microsoft stuff. An old 3DSPaint account I have also can't be recovered (cough cough @DigitalCheese cough cough) but I can recover via IPs if the IPs are the same.
<br><br>
I have tried 4 different emails at this point and none of them work. Google is strict, but not this bad. At least it's reasonable to recover accounts and change emails. So yeah, overall I am stuck from accessing my email and now I need to figure out how to recover that. Just fun. Really goes to show that microsoft should improve how that works. If you have Windows Hello set up, it should work. I really should just get a simple flash drive meant to login to all my accounts if needed at this point because apparently having set up a pin that should log you in doesn't work.
<br><br>
TLDR; losing a microsoft email that you have had for 2 years can start a new civil war with your accounts.

<summary>Why Pokemon Sword and Shield Suck | 1/22/2022 11:13 PM</summary>
Hello all SDK Members. I believe pokemon sword and shield suck. Wow, such a strange opinion. We have never heard of that before (looking at the vast majority of people hating it or not having as fun as the previous games). There are a lot of reasons for my opinion though. Why else do you think I am writing this blog? Now onto the reasons.<br>
<p1 style="color:gold">---------------</p1><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">1. Bad Animations</summary>
This was perfectly ok on the 3DS and before because they were weaker. Before gen 6, they were 2D games anyways and they basically got better each time. Even gen 6 was decent in animations for the first time. Gen 7 pushed the limits of both graphics and storage to a point of being 4.7GB and had to remove triple battles so even if it was possible it made sense. Also, models were future proofed so that's another reason they didn't work so well and it lagged. Basically, it was fair that the games didn't have good animations at the time.
<br><br>
Considering what I said above, you would then expect that in gen 8, we could have better animations and the same models + textures with all the pokemon. Well no. They cut most of the pokemon and made it so there were a tiny bit over 400. This was bad of course. Even with the DLCs, we only get 649 pokemon. So if they cut half the pokemon at launch to give more room for having better graphics, they must have done it REAL good right? Nope. They were actually very lazy. As usual, they didn't try. And they had half the work to do this time. I have some YouTube videos I uploaded making fun of this stuff and there are many people who have pointed this out. People were able to go into the game (hax) and went through the files. Some images below.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Now, you probably expected them to do this for the most part. But then they used it as a reason to justify removing over 300 pokemon (there is also the balance argument but I will get to that soon) which isn't right. They found out, the models were the same other than very minor changes to specific pokemon. You may then say "alright but at least triple battles should be back right?" and to that I say, no they aren't back either. They basically removed a lot and didn't do something worth the removal of all that stuff.
<br><br>
Now there is another argument and that is balance. This is stupid. Where was this supposed balance in Gen 5 (Lando T), Gen 6 (Megas), or Gen 7 (megas and z crystals but not both on one pokemon)? Oh right. It didn't exist. It is almost like this isn't true. What a surprise. Side Rant:
<br><br>
I don't know why companies think they can't be outsmarted by the internet. It doesn't make sense. For some reason, companies (especially old ones) think people on places like Reddit and 4chan won't outsmart them. Even here, at least one person could likely prove this easily. They need to learn that doesn't work anymore as it is 2022 (2019 at the time) so you can't do this anymore.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">2. More Expensive</summary>
We already know that pokemon is basically a monopoly. The best chance of beating them is via romhacks and even then, ever since like 2018-2019, they have been way more strict. Good luck finding a replacement to a lot of old romhacks. Most games that will "take over pokemon" are forgotten after like a year or two unless you are REALLY a big fan of them. Weirdly, the closest you get is Monster Hunter in my opinion and even then, not perfectly.
<br><br>
As you know, they have clothes, a card game, video games, and more. This time, they made the games $60 instead of $40 of the other games (yes including the 3DS games). This time they have DLC instead too (you can't buy the two DLCs separately so $30). Now some say the argument of "wElL iT iS bEtTeR tHaN tWo GaMeS aNd ChEaPeR" however, upon a bit of thinking, this is not the case.
<br><br>
So before with the old model of having a third game, there would be the two main games ($40). After a bit, there would be a superior third game ($40 as well). So basically if SwSh had the old model, yes it would be more because the games are $60 each even if they dropped the price to 40 but not SwSh's price. For every main line game before SwSh, they were around 40 dollars each. They too often had a third game. The only exceptions were BW2 and the Ultra Games. BW2 were sequels so we can ignore those. Ultra games obviously were worse than DLC in that case. So for gen 6 and below:
<br><br>
$40 (whichever first game)<br>
$40 (new game)<br>
Total is $80.
<br><br>
Gen 8 logic:<br>
$60 (main game)<br>
$30 (DLC)<br>
Total: $90
<br><br>
We have been tricked, backstabbed, and quite possibly bamboozled by GameFreak here. So basically, you got to have a free save file (great if no hax or pre switch game) and some new stuff for 10 dollars cheaper than the DLC stuff. Logic. To be fair, if you share a switch this is actually still better price-wise because you can have 8 users so 8 saves. Though I still wouldn't recommend these games. Basically, they are more expensive price-wise when they are basically worse in almost every way on a better hardware system despite prev gens being cheaper? I got to give it to them that they made it seem better and cheaper for the consumer when in reality it was a trick this whole time. Genius move for money but not if you want morals still (this is a big company though so who cares about morals xD).
<br><br>
Some people may say "wElL aDd TaXeS" but we need to add to both and even then, they vary depending on where you live so I won't account for that. There is also stuff such as NSO and Home but NSO isn't really Nintendo's fault. Now, as for Pokemon Home, it is a scam. Just make a $20 software that allows you to store lots of pokemon online and offline. Some may say these pokemon are too big to cheaply do this but these pokemon are very small. To prove my point with a hacked N3DSXL, I will go onto PKSM and make a 200 Box sized thing for you to see what it is generally like. They are not that hard to store.
<br><br>
Just making a google account basically allows you to have a lifetime of pokemon unless you have the whole world catching and transfering, but even then, its kinda hard to run out of storage thanks to PKSM on 3DS (and PKMN Chest on DS, DSi, and 3DS flashcarts or SD Cards). Below are photos of my proof. I can't show every single one of those 200 boxes here of course because that would take forever and even then, DSis and 3DSes likely would run out of memory. I will have two copies of 100 boxes.
<br><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100166_1.jpg"><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100166_2.jpg">
<br><br>
So it is over priced basically. Just use hacks on 3DS and Switch. It is much better and you will enjoy it more. In case you are wondering, I used Shiny Xerneas' with Pokerus, a custom nickname, and some moves. I may be able to share bank files with you if I can find legality. Until then, I won't share exact boxes just so you know. They made everything horrible as you could tell. They also made it more expensive while hiding the price to seem less expensive for the most part.

<summary class="spoiler">3. Horrible Online</summary>
This is the last reason. Gens 1-3 didn't have online of course. Gen 4 did but only on an old internet security standard or being completely open. Gen 5 had WPA2-AES support on DSi and above. Every game after that supported that as well.
<br><br>
Gen 5 was 2nd best as it had voice calls in Pokemon Black and White 2. Gen 6 didn't have that, but it was the most convenient thing ever. Acquaintances for previous people you interacted with, friends list, favorites, and also everyone else. You also could have something such as a custom PFP too which was cool. Gen 7 had a cool idea that they forced as a part of online which made it suck. Maybe for local it would be whatever.
<br><br>
For some reason, gen 8 is worse. They don't allow directly finding friends for some reason. They should have gone with a gen 6 like design. Friends, Acquaintances, Favs, etc. They should keep the code system as its a cool idea to make it so you don't have to exchange FCs to battle or trade. Also, they removed the GTS which was added back in Home requiring a phone to trade in anyways. They aren't even doing it for money at that point because you can use GTS for free in home but only with a phone or other mobile device.
<br><br>
There also is no voice chat. Unless if the NSO app allows it, there is no reason it should be denied. In fact, it should be allowed for headphones. To be fair on GameFreak for once, this is an issue with most switch games that have online except Fortnite and probably a few other games. This is pathetic since gen 4-6 had voice chat and gen 5 had video chat. Yeah, video chat with up to four friends (online too if you all have Black and White 2). That is sad and pathetic a switch game couldn't have voice chat.
<br><br>
Another thing they took out even with Home having the GTS is custom messages. XY for example, allowed custom messages. Even with long YT/Discord/Insta names, it wouldn't be solved if you have a shorter name. Plain simple. So instead of YT=DigitalCheese75, you could have YT=DCGamr75. It would be shorter and you would get around gen 7/8 stuff. Doesn't make any sense but whatever. Gen 8 really had so much potential.</details>

You may wonder why I put spoiler buttons for each point, but the reason is how long it is. If you read it all, hope you enjoyed the blog and maybe agree with me. This is all my opinion so don't go cry on Twitter about me being an idiot and trying to cancel me somehow. Thanks for reading again :]
<br><br>
Edit: I have decided to upload the Banks onto Google Drive for anyone to view. Here is the link. Enjoy all those pokemon
<br><br>
Also, I did some math and if I am correct (I did 2 banks of 100 boxes multiplied by 50 million), this could all fit within 100GB. Give it 2TB, and you are set for probably so long that the cartridges on older games like FRLG and even SwSh probably wouldn't work anymore. I made this far huh. So basically a couple of 1-2TB hard drives could hold it all. Instead, Home should be a service where you pay 30 bucks and get as much as you can save on an SD Card or System Memory. You can then backup 30k pokemon in the cloud.

<summary>Death Free Trial Review | 1/29/2022 8:15 PM</summary>
Hey guys. I would like to give my opinion on the death free trial that you can use called sleeping.<br>
<p1 style="color:gold">--------------</p1><br>
1. Gameplay<br>
This is something I can't remember much of, but seemed fun. One thing I hate tho is that it eventually ends for a temporary amount of time. Luckily, u often feel good after 5 min anyways. Dreams were cool too. Very fun but can't remember them.
<br><br>
Also, there is a glitch where other players not in the free trial, can interuppt you. This part sucks. Hope they patch this.
<br><br>
2. Graphics<br>
Too simple. Wish they were better. Maybe add a little detail.
<br><br>
3. OST<br>
There isn't one. Please add it. Even if just 5 songs. This game would be more fun that way. Also, my audience of 76 Subscribers on YouTube would like it.<br>
<p1 style="color:gold">--------------</p1><br>
Overall, I give this free trial a 6/10. Mainly fix da bug and add audio at least. Otherwise, good game and [sarcasm]I will consider purchasing the full game despite these issues.[/sarcasm] Thanks for reading my review especially if you are the devs.
<br><br>

<summary>Progress of the AntiTikTok Union Site | 2/04/2022 7:09 PM</summary>
Hey guys. Today I will be talking about the AntiTikTok Union's Site Progress. So far, I have 5 pages. Homepage, Dangerous Challenges, Feedback, Creators, and Chatrooms via Cbox. I am going to be adding a section for cringe content and make it easy to go backwards by clicking a special homepage button and another button to return to whatever page you normally have to go to so you can get to a specific page. Figuring out what the button sizes should be. Probably 64x64 though.<br><br>
In the Dangerous Challenges Section, I don't have much. I just gave a simple explanation of them. The Feedback page can be removed and put on the homepage I believe. Creators will be expanded upon as time goes on so if someone else joins to help or I am allowed to put something like a YT video by them on the site. Off-Topic is basically if you get bored and wanna do something like share your opinions about TikTok with other ppl somewhere other than the regular places. There are 4 chatrooms as of now. There are filters for words like the f-slur but you can scream FUCK randomly.<br><br>
Backgrounds really need to be improved. The Creators Section is fine but the others I need to change. Most either have horrible images or are just a black background. Also, I need to just start putting images/videos in general. It would really help I assume. Luckily, I have started to get better at HTML/CSS. Still doing inline though. If I can change that, it would make things much easier and probably smaller in size even with a lot of storage. 1GB is small, but when you can have site embeds for YouTube videos and under emergency situations, images/gifs, it is very easy to make the site. I may get Neocities Supporter one day which would give me more storage and multiple sites on one account so I could reasonably have stuff like an AntiTwitter Union, AntiFacebook Union, and a site dedicated to my empire.<br><br>
Fun fact: Its called the AntiTikTok Union site instead of the DC Empire site because the name is what a discord server is also called. It is my fan-made site that is basically official other than what another guy named Draglox is doing his own version so yea.<br><br>
But yeah that's all for now. Thx for reading the update. If you want to visit the site, click the link below. As a warning: It can run on N3DS, but doesn't work on DSi and O3DS I believe. PC is best for this site especially with the chatroom page.<br><br>

<summary>Why YouTube Dislike Removal is Bad | 2/05/2022 7:29 PM</summary>
YouTube Dislikes being removed for the most part is pretty bad. Below are some reasons why.<br>
<p1 style="color:gold">----------</p1><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">1. Protects Big Tech</summary>
This is pretty obvious. They claim its for the mental health of small creators, but they didn't really care at all until now. It's blatant they want to protect big tech more or just big companies and censor people in general. Its not like dislikes even affect the algorithm much. Millions if not billions of videos have lots of dislikes while also being very popular. If it does have an effect, it's very small and somehow so small that it wouldn't even affect a video for the most part.<br><br>
Also, as for that mental health thing, only the most sensitive people in the world who really shouldn't have made a YouTube channel would get offended at this. How many people do you know that are crying when someone calls them gay in the YouTube comment section and says nothing else or dislikes the video and says L+Ratio or something stupid like that? Nearly no one if I had to take a guess. No one is offended. Their reasoning for not just ignoring this? Apparently they said how most people get "harassed" for turning them off. There argument would be a good point if it wasn't so conveniently the fact that when people disable them, they often are trying to hide stuff. There are exceptions, but most of the time, it's to try to hide something. Even then, Return YouTube Dislikes solves it because its still something in the API through enough effort.<br><br>
So what are they doing here? Manipulation and censorship is what I declare it. What else could they do that for? It only seems like it was made for more manipulating people. Just like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and more nowadays. Next they are going to say "people were harassed in the comment section so to prevent people from having to make a choice, we will just remove them entireity". I swear that they know all the right moves and they are intentionally picking the wrong ones at this point.
</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">2. Scams</summary>
Sadly scams will exist. People pointed this out and on Twitter, YouTube just said "oH wElL tHiS iSn'T aLlOwEd So HoW cOuLd YoU sEe ThE tHiNg?". This is especially bad with tech support because that may lead to people learning things that aren't even true. For example, they may thing you can ignore the semicolon in code for HTML or something as an example (no one is that dumb I bet, but its close to possible).<br><br>
Another thing is that people like Professors often may use YouTube to get resources more easily for learning as a random Indian guy speaking Hindi can explain things perfectly all the time. Imagine how much of a backwards step we would go if they decided to never add dislikes back. Other than already proven to be true stuff, we would be screwed. This makes research much harder for the average person as most people probably aren't going to conduct the entire experiment to find one question, but google it and find a YouTube video on it.<br><br>
This won't be fun. Just amazing that now when someone makes something cool, we have to be even more careful. It is mainly scams that are proven via dislikes because the only way to hide dislikes is disabling likes too (before the change). Now the only way to adapt is saying "oh well there are 5k likes on a vid with 20M views so it must suck" even if in reality, it is a good video. It is annoying.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">3. Future Dramas</summary>
They are now ruined. This may seem stupid but often times, the winner was determined by likes/dislikes on any of their videos. If I ratioed you and I had 800k likes and 49k dislikes but you only had 49k likes and 352k dislikes, I would likely be the winner if you can't win after that. Now you just have the like ratio which could easily be annoying.<br><br>
You could argue that we can comment "use as dislike" but people would delete it unless they are completely stupid. If they are trying to hide they did something, they are never going to let people say to use their comment as a dislike. Knowing modern YouTube, it will likely take down a video saying to use it as a dislike because it would likely be a supposed form of harassment which is very dumb considering the decision made.<br><br>
I don't know if YouTube/Google was high while making this decision and still are somehow, but this is horrible. Susan sucks at being CEO in my opinion. She basically removed all the cool stuff like messages, groups, and more. What we are now left with is an old site that is going downhill and could die that way. If YouTube somehow died, it would be absolute chaos for some (but maybe a little fun for others) as the internet would be heavily decentralized for the first time in around 10 years. People would be forced to actually learn how to do things. That or maybe people would just go to Odysee. Idk exactly xD. This isn't likely, but it would be funny</details>
<p1 style="color:gold">----------</p1><br>
Thanks for reading this blog. YouTube removing the dislikes is a horrible decision. Now I wonder how bad it would be if the SDK Community removed dislikes. Probably wouldn't do much because of how small the site is now but still bad.<br><br>
If you want YouTube Dislikes back, download Return YouTube Dislikes on Opera GX if you are cool or Google Chrome if you are exactly like everyone else being b o r i n g. Bye bye for now
<blockquote>Draconid_Jo has a comment that I figured would be important enough to feature here more easily. It somewhat makes a good point.
<hr>
<p1>IDK, I can honestly see both sides of this, having been witness to (and on the recieving end of) unjust censorship at the hands of blogmins here, not so constructive critical blog comments, as well as blogs getting ridiculous numbers of dislikes that they very clearly didn't deserve.</p1><br><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Explanation</summary>
Part of the problem with the internet is that there are some people out there who abuse the relative freedom and anonymity (which are under attack by big tech, as you correctly point out in this blog) that it provides to do things that are just completely asinine, and while I am a strong believer in freedom of speech, I don't think that the purpose of freedom of speech is to make counterproductive, offensive comments about eating rabbits on a YouTube video about taking proper care of pet rabbits, for example.<br>
(And that's pretty mild compared to a lot of the other things that people will say in the comments of YouTube videos, which I'd rather not repeat here.)<br><br>
As for the dislike thing, one problem that I have with how dislikes work here on Paint, and that is how you can clearly see who likes your blogs on here, but you can't tell who dislikes them, leading to ridiculous situations like my best friend @Tora-Kokoro 's fact check blog about furries, which got a bunch of dislikes just because a bunch of nasty, simpleminded, lowlife furry haters decided to dislike it, not because of the actual content of the blog, but simply because they hate furries.<br><br>
(And they were all too cowardly to leave critical comments explaining why they disliked it so much, which says a lot IMO.)

<summary>New Background in my Empire | 2/08/2022 11:51 AM</summary>
So recently I saw some complaints about the background and highlighting. Other than laziness by them to already know this, I realized something. 4k GIF hacker background and highlighting wasn't working! Such a shocking thing. Who would have guessed!? I had to hire a professional to help me with that one.
<br><br>
Idk about highlighting, but I got the background changed to one of my paintings on DSiPaint. If I can figure out the highlighting thing, it will be fixed. Enjoy the revamped haclkr group :)

<summary>DC Empire Roblox Group | 2/09/2022 2:59 PM</summary>
Hey guys :D
<br><br>
I would like to announce my roblox group called Da Official Digital Cheese Empire. Its a few years old technically. No allies/enemies too. I have a simple chat game in the 'Experiences' section.
<br><br>
If you want to add me as a friend, username is @SuperPizzaGamer5027 so yea. MSGs better than chat.
<br><br>
I will make a PvP game eventually including allowing private servers. Both Chat and PvP will allow private servers for bobux. Enjoy the empire. I will add it to my empire section on Paint

<summary>AntiTikTok Union Site Progress 2 | 2/09/2022 11:24 PM</summary>
Hello guys. Today I made major progress on this site. So basically, I changed up the backgrounds a bit for one. That was pretty cool. Also, I managed to figure out why .css files didn't work and now I have convenience. I updated the censorship area for the stuff about why TikTok is bad.
<br><br>
I will try to add music there too! Mostly my own themes, but likely some other things like Eminem music via YouTube embeds. This should be very fun xD. The reason it would mainly be my music is the fact that I need to avoid copyright lmao. If I can avoid that, I am at a big advantage. If someone wants to create music for me to use on the site, DM me here or email me to be able to make music for the site. If you do and I approve of it, I will gladly give you credit. I will not put a TikTok link. I will put something like your 3DSPaint or YouTube though.
<br><br>
If you have suggestions, please comment it. Thanks for reading this blog. If you liek it, liek it. If you disliek it, disliek it.<br>

<summary>Python/C++ and Why I Am Interested | 2/11/2022 12:11 AM</summary>
Python and C++ seems fun to learn. The languages seem very useful to me. Python could be used for something like a calculator on the Nintendo 3DS. C++ could be used for games as well. This seems very fun to learn and I am excited to do so. I wonder what I could do with the languages.

<summary>Dangers of the Earn IT Act | 2/11/2022 10:54 PM</summary>
Recently, the Earn IT Act was made to try to supposedly stop stuff such as Club Penguin if you know what I mean. Considering the history of this kind of stuff, this probably won't do anything except bad.<br>
<p1 style="color:gold">-----------</p1><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">1. Less Security</summary>
This is pretty major. Sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and even this site (maybe) all have features to reduce the chance of security flaws. If this act gets passed, the companies would basically be forced to allow backdoors.<br><br>
Of course, FBI have access to it. But if you have the perfect security and add a backdoor for it, you already weakened the security. As people have said before, if a backdoor is added for 1 group of people, others WILL find and exploit it.<br><br>
Whats even sadder is that this could even affect the SDK Community if it got much bigger than it is now. We are small luckily, but if HullBreach had to get a fine because this site had something deemed as bad, this wouldn't work too good and may make this site go down too. Now I doubt CP would be on here, but an opinion that these people don't like could be instead.<br><br>
Even other countries may be affected as lots of companies are in the US and as a result, follow US law. Also, VPNs wouldn't save you as they would use tev-ch to basically make it so they are useless to hide like that. It likely won't be</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">2. Censorship</summary>
Do you really think they are going to do good with this? If they do anything, it will be bad stuff. They pick basically all the options wrong.<br><br>
What if a 10 yo here made an edgy joke that just so happens to be against political norms? They likely would be fine because they are 10 (however even thats closing and likely won't be an excuse for long), but someone who is 15 likely wouldn't be able to.<br><br>
While they may not be banned here, they could get in major legal trouble. This system is horrible. It's just for control.<br><br>
I hate when people say "free speech can still have consequences" because the whole point of free speech is saying whatever shit you want without people being able to do something such as fine you, arrest you, or do another thing. We are censored enough on the internet via big sites.<br><br>
Imagine if punishments go from get simply unpromoted in an algorithm or a ban to extreme legal consequences. We can be shamed by the community for a view, but not banned unles you are a pedo (maybe add a little more such as no extreme racism). This still would allow free speech while not getting a ban from the site.<br><br>
I like that system more than this Earn IT Act bullshit. It works well and its the people who decides whether certain things are fine.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">3. Uselessness</summary>
There is no way to reasonably monitor this. Especially on YouTube and Reddit.<br><br>
YouTube is a video sharing site as y'all know. We already have a hard time with the bullshit copyright system. Don't believe me? Try using copyrighted music in 2022. Even if you use it in a way Fair Use allows, the automatic system means within seconds will claim the video and all money you get from it if you make it.<br><br>
Rant aside, there is so many videos uploaded daily that when you try to moderate even with extremely advanced AI, it is near impossible.<br><br>
Reddit is known as the place with waaaaaaay too many NSFW subs. What if a subreddit like that is on except breaking TOS and dealing CP and now they are in hot water? Yeah I'd like to see if they could even survive because of the amount of NSFW subs out there. You physically can't moderate it and we already have enough there. Power hungry mods like GallowBoob, no freedom of speech on a site originally known as a bastion of free speech, worst updates possible (except on Old Reddit at this point), and probably more.<br><br>
Both of these can't be reasonably moderated. Also, this would even affect the warzone that is 4chan and 54 member Discord servers without community settings on. Imagine if they finally made a dent on 4chan of all sites. Odds are, something like Pokemon BW2 Video Calls or RiiConnect24 would be the safest form of communication and the most free. Also, Swapdoodle on 3DS too. I can't imagine the danger of this too. Also, the irony of 4chan having less free speech than a hacked Wii or any 3DS in general.</details>
<p1 style="color:gold">-----------</p1><br>
Thanks for reading this. If you want to get my 3DS FC, RiiConnect24 Code, and Pokemon BW2 FC, DM me on 3DSPaint. Thats likely going to be our best communication method in the future. Another side note: A Switch with NSO and Animal Crossing New Horizons might be good but slow as hell.<br><br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/gany6sk6ojc">Click here for SOG's video about this subject</a>. If I had to take a guess or two, my outcomes vary heavily.<br><br>
1. Internet is Destroyed<br>
Most people would quit the internet or be forced to learn so much, Even people like me would. Someone like HullBreach or GuiedGui may be able to navigate that easily luckily.<br><br>
2. Nothing Happens<br>
This is hoped for. Hope this act doesn't go through. If it fails entirely or just isn't used much, we would be saved.<br><br>
Thanks for reading this blog. This is bad news if it actually does something major.
<blockquote>Will note some of what I said was a little stupid, but even now some of the points still hold up (such as this being a shitty idea). Also thank god this seems to have never ended up doing shit lol. Would've been major.</blockquote>

<summary>Are Racists Bad? No!!! | 2/13/2022 10:01 PM</summary>
Hello all fellow racists. Some people say us racists are bad, but we actually are very nice. Some say racists are people who hate specific people just because of their skin color. While yes that is one definition because of pathetic failures, this isn't the correct one most of us are luckily. I am talking about the other racists who just like driving race cars and racing people. That is the main people
<br><br>
We are very good at racing. We are even willing to make us look like bad people even if we are actually the nicest people around. Us racists don't support being mean to people except if it is laughing when someone is in last place while we are at first, but who wouldn't want to laugh at that? I just want to protect all the racists who are unfairly treated just because of some bad people. We do not accept those other "racists" who will be mean just because you aren't a specific race. That is wrong and very, very gae according to me (the gae part according to anyone with 5 braincells).
<br><br>
So go out and support your local racists. RACIST LIVES MATTER. Just don't cry when we are the ones to win the Mario Kart race. Thanks for reading this blog. I hope it was very inspiring or at least educational about racists and taught you that we don't accept those other pathetic racists who are mean to people just because of their skin color. I am out for now, campaigning for RACIST LIVES MATTER so yea.

<summary>Valentine's Day for Me | 2/15/2022 12:32 AM</summary>
So today, it is apparently valentines day. I forgot that even existed for basically forever. It may just be me, but I barely remember it lmao.<br><br>
Today it was very simple though. We didnt have much big stuff. I don't have a valentine, I forget it exists, bla bla bla. Most (or some) people have a valentine but really I don't. Personally, I think everyone reading this wasn't surprised and would be surprised if I even tried to do so xD. Basically, I am now up at 11:18pm and will likely stay up until 2-3am.<br><br>
Most "eventful" thing that happened was me uploading my <a href="https://youtu.be/NN5hYd4W2IM">speedpaint video</a> which basically means, nothing eventful. Christmas and Halloween are the best honestly. Halloween you basically get lots of free candy. Christmas you get or give gifts. They are the best in my opinion xDDDDDDD. Also, since I live in the south (not southern hemisphere, south in the US), it is not 5 degrees Fahrenheit so thats noice. It's still cold, but not too much.<br><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Side Note About YouTube and Stuff</summary>
I have heavily re-organized my videos. I am also going to edit stuff such as the descriptions for each video so that way it will be more recent since stuff like CloneMii have shutdown. Now as a result, blogs like the blog I made about good sites on Wii U or 3DS (I think) aren't 100% updated and I may soon. That or a new blog.<br><br>
Back to the YT thing, there are 5 playlists. Updates, Gaming, Art/Animation, Memes, and "Secret". The first four are easy enough to understand. The last one being "Secret" is different though. If I am possibly going to take a while to make a new video, or I just uploaded 10 videos all of the sudden and I decided to make more but not release yet, I can upload it there. In most cases, I will also be able to just delist videos that were absolute shit so that way it can be viewed still, but its randomly there so yea. I had a few like that for a while.<br><br>
I presume the "secret" playlist will be very useful. As of now, its all just unlisted videos I made that sucked so badly, I decided to save the average person from cringe. Well basically no as its all there in the secret tab. Should be amazing to some people.</details>
Thanks for reading bleg. Give liek or disliek if you want.

<summary>Things You NEED to Get On 3DS Before E-shop Closure | 2/17/2022 3:25 AM</summary>
Hello Guys. As Lizzie14 reported in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230104215124/https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=100226" style="color:pink">blog by her</a>, the e-Shop will eventually close soon. I also made a <a href="https://youtu.be/4_bREinMXnl" style="color:red">YouTube video</a> about this. Here are some essentials to get before shutdown or after via using REDACTED.<br><br>
Side Note: I will give price and some other info so yeah.<br>
<p1 style="color:gold">-----------</p1>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">1. Pokemon Dream Radar</summary>
This is a pretty cool game using the 3DS Camera. You can also get 3 legendaries. This is mainly a custom addon for PKMN BW2.<br><br>
Items are easy to get in it. Sadly, you barely have any slots to store stuff so yeah. The items are stuff like revives and berries. As for the pokemon, you can get multiple legendaries off of it (some requires other games like PKMN DP). You also get pokemon that have special stuff (such as abilities).<br><br>
One tip is to stop moderating a discord server and walk a lot for 300 play coins. You get 10 daily, but try changing the date. You can also change the date on Dream Radar weirdly so idk xD. This game is $3 so get it soon.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">2. Swapnote/Swapdoodle</summary>
Swapdoodle is a messaging service for 3DS. Its also a sequel to Swapnote which you also should download. You can add images, draw a decent bit, and more.<br><br>
By default, you only have 200 notes. Starter Pack and a switch tutorial is free so download that too. After downloading those when spam saving notes, you will have more space. 300 notes/replies, 3 colors, and some drawing tutorials. You can reply to notes after becoming a doodle pal.<br><br>
Unlike Swapnote, certain photos can't be uploaded, audio is unavailable, and Swapnote has 3k storage for free unlike Swapdoodle. Swapnote is offline only. Swapdoodle allows online though. Swapnote allows streetpass msgs. Swapdoodle doesn't allow that however.<br><br>
These are technically free. There is DLC in Swapdoodle though. Get them soon.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">3. Flipnote Studio 3D</summary>
FS3D is an animation software for 3DS. This software is very good so yeah. Its a sequel to the DSi's software.<br><br>
There are more colors, 3 layers, 0.00001% better camera, 4 SFX, and more speeds. You can save 10k flipnotes. This number will be less if you don't have enough space. There is no online without hax. With hax, you can use Kaeru Gallery. You can also send flipnotes to friends directly or export a flipnote as a sequential gif or shitty AVI videos. Best is just use Flipnote Player.<br><br>
It is free, but you need special methods unlike other games here. You need to go to My Nintendo and get enough silver points. After, you must download on e-Shop via download codes.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">4. Colors! 3D</summary>
This is an art software that is a sequel to the DS homebrew Colors! so yeah. It has its own place to directly upload art. You can upload 3 daily.<br><br>
You have lots of colors, images for reference, 5 layers, art replays, 3D drawings, and more. This is an amazing art tool. You can't upload replays to YouTube though. This game is $7 though. Its worth it every bit however.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">5. Pokemon Bank/Poke Transporter</summary>
This is great for pokemon players. You can store 3k pokemon on it. Its $5 yearly, but when the e-Shop closes, it will be free assuming you downloaded before closure.<br><br>
You can transfer pokemon from gen 5, but you need Poke Transporter so get that downloaded too. You can't find normally on eshop, only by installing in Pokemon Bank. This is highly recommended if you pkay gen 6/7 pokemon games.<br><br>
You can also transfer to pokemon home if you want. You can pick whatever boxes you want too. Note that even in 2023, Pokemon Home costs money. Make sure that until 2023, you either keep your pokemon safe in games or pay for Bank mkay? Mkay good.</details>
<p1 style="color:gold">-----------</p1><br>
Thanks for reading. I hope this is helpful. Get themes as well if you want to do so. I have no clue why Nintendo is so stupid and does this. I'd expect online play to die in 2027 at latest. For blog submission and legal reasons, plz no pirate.

<summary>How to Solve Poverty (REAL PARODY) | 2/22/2022 1:31 AM</summary>
Ok so I have figured it out. Brandon should retire from president and elect an edgy 12 year old to do all the work. I could get the USA out of debt and solve poverty.<br><br>
So essentially, there are multiple things we must solve to solve poverty:<br>
- Homelessness<br>
- Starving<br>
- Money<br><br>
So basically, people just need to get a home to solve homelessness. Idk why people don't do this. Like bro, they complain about being homeless yet all they have to do is get a home bro. I am not sarcastic for sure here.<br><br>
Now we need to solve starving people and money. To solve money, print more money. Its simple bros. That is all we have to do.<br><br>
Now we are only left with one issue left. Food. People just need to eat bro. It's not hard. Teach people how to eat, and all that is solved.<br><br>
So basically, I just solved major issues in our society already if this is done. I'm smart 10/10.<br><br>
Thanks for reading this beautiful blog :D

<summary>Addressing the Dreamphobic/Homophobic Controversy That You Don't Care About | 3/02/2022 11:00 PM</summary>
Hello guys. *Sighs hard*<br>
I have to admit to something that was very horrible I did in the past. I was very dreamphobic. So basically, on reddit I said something very bad and did it constantly. I said the word gay. I know, it is the most offensive thing ever and I am not being sarcastic. I don't need to explain the totally homophobic crimes that I did.<br><br>
You might be confused by dreamphobia claims. Basically, dreamsexuals are people who's sexuality is dreamsexual because they really like Dream. Dream is a minecraft YouTuber for those who do not know. I know I am offending people who are totally not completely retarded. Ignore the fact that I am making fun of idiots and that the dreamsexual people are really just having a crush on a fucking Minecraft oooTuber.<br><br>
Thank you for reading this. I will be taking a 5 minute break from technology in general and touch grass. I will be back within 5 minutes. I am prepared for whatever totally rel "hate" I will get for this.

<summary>To All Sudomemo Users | 3/23/2022 2:30 AM</summary>
Lets team up and make it so every flipnote we make gets to the trending page. Basically, all of us give each other 10 yellow stars on our flipnotes and if we want to, some green and red. I have like 15 green and 8 red right now so yay. The current amount of users will be below along with the FSIDs. Currently there are 4 users so every flipnote can have 30 yellow stars at least. Take a few per flipnote to prevent it from looking like its alt accounts (such as giving 7 stars instead of ten or giving a green/red star).
<br><br>
My FSID: 58F5E5A0A0876D28<br>
Itzako's FSID: 50477F5027531A4D<br>
Weeeheep's FSID: 57D02F0027535AE6<br>
Yeuron's FSID: 5D5ADEB059A40C39
<br><br>
But yeah, thats the current number of potential stars we can have per flipnote. If I added some irl friends into the mix, we might get up to 60~ stars per flipnote.

<summary>Idk I made another meme blog plz dont take seriously (swear word warning but u dont care) | 3/29/2022 1:01 AM</summary>
You may wonder how I could ever get more bitches than you. After all, I'm a 112 sub YouTuber who is 12 and making commentary videos in his bedroom that hates social interaction. Well, it's because I know what 6+9 is. 6+9=420
<br><br>
I could lose my chin and I would have one bitch left. One bitch is still better than 0 bitches. This blog is definitely not a meme as I totally would never make a meme blog. After all, i havent basically spammed letters for blogs before or said that I am a racist so I will be the best at racing you.
<blockquote>This blog is sarcasm, also I am no longer 12 as of the creation of this archive and will probably consider this more gay as time goes on.</blockquote>

<summary>Toxic Distress vs Lerix Commentary Drama | 3/29/2022 1:11 AM</summary>
So recently there was a little drama between Toxic Distress and Lerix on YouTube (Lerix basically had like one tweet and essentially won the thing xD). I have been making a YouTube video on the drama. Toxic Distress basically was fully lost here lmaooooooo. He made 3 videos basically saying the same shit and then Lerix says one tweet replying about how people were thinking liking anime on twitter makes him some fucking weirdo. I just love logic lmaooooo. Then TD makes a 4th video apologizing and basically talks about some extra shit too. The 2nd video in general was strange because it ended up being 6 minutes of BS so ye. This was pretty interesting for a channel that started 2 months before mine.

<summary>Custom Channel Link | 3/29/2022 1:20 AM</summary>
Hello everyone! I have amazing news as of recently. I have been gaining subs much more faster than usual. For the past few months, I have gained major amounts of views and subscribers. December 2021 to March 2022 is what I am counting (and soon April). I can't believe it is so quickly growing. I have gained 42 subs this year and in december 2021, I gained 9 subs so yey. That would be 51 subs from December to March 2022.
<br><br>
As for views and watch hours, I have gained 3.8K views and 46.9 watch hours. Now what does this all have to do with a custom YouTube channel link for me? Well, the requirements are very specific as you would expect for this one.
<br><br>
Requirements:<br>
100 Subscribers<br>
30 Days+<br>
Have Profile Picture<br>
Have Profile Banner
<br><br>
After meeting all the requirements, I finally could get the channel link. I have had most of these requirements for years. The only thing I needed was 100+ subs. It took over 2 years, but I am finally there :D
<br><br>
I made the channel link name DigitalCheese. Full link: <a href="https://youtube.com/c/DigitalCheese">https://youtube.com/c/DigitalCheese</a>
<br><br>
This will be very fun and cool and stuff so yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay :DDDDDDDDDDDD

<summary>(OUTDATED) M4A Audio Download for Videos | 3/29/2022 1:31 AM</summary>
I have recently decided to start making most of my commentaries have M4A audio downloads via Google Drive. This will be very fun if you want to listen on DSi/3DS later and can't hack it to use Rvid files via TWLMenu++ so yea.
<br><br>
Google Drive Video-to-Audio Folder
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy this very cool thing. To use on DSi, copy files from PC to any folder on DSi (such as /Entertainment/Audio/Commentary which you will need to make yourself).

Great News! I have finally got to 20 followers on Sudomemo. I see this as an absolute win! I am making a flipnote on it right now. As of this blog, i have 38 frames of that flipnote done of the 430 in total there. I hope you enjoy it when it comes out :D

<summary>FS3D Camera Experimentation | 3/30/2022 3:05 PM</summary>
I have been messing around with FS3D's camera feature which is more convenient than the DSi version. Also, it has more space for flipnotes so as a result, I can make something better. So far, I have managed to get a flipnote to be nearly 3MB large. This is very cool for me so I will have fun with that. I uploaded 2 test flipnotes to Kaeru Gallery. My username is Digital Cheese there so enjoy them. You will need to use a hacked 3DS/2DS for Kaeru as a warning.

<summary>Winning the Sudomemo WT Twice in a Row | 4/04/2022 2:50 AM</summary>
Hello everyone :D<br>
I have won the Sudomemo WT for the 2nd time in a row. It was easier than usual because there weren't even 5 submissions when normally there are 5 xD. Either way, I have over a month of Sudomemo Plus and some extra stars as a result :)
<br><br>
This blog is short, but I really don't care lol. I am almost at 100 blogs on 3DSPaint within less than a year of me being on this epik website. This site is still pretty good and it actually got bigger while I was on here. Coincidence? Probably so lmao. I'm a moderator of BetaTube as of now so thats cool. In a few days, I will have been here for a whole year.
<br><br>
Side rant over, thanks for reading this blog and hope I win the new WT.<br>
For those on a DSi with Flipnote or a hacked 3DS with flipnote dsi, you can find the new WT flipnote by either <a href="https://flipnot.es/81JDWV">clicking here</a> or searching up the Flipnote ID which is "81JDWV".

<summary>R.I.P. BetaTube | 4/07/2022 2:16 AM</summary>
Today, BetaTube finally shut down. For those who don't know, BetaTube is a YouTube clone that was recreating the 2012/2013 style. I was a mod on there. The final days were chaos. I am making an Odysee video for that so you can go watch it there when its out. I would just like to take a moment of your time to mourn the death of this platform not even lasting 5 months.
<br><br>
R.I.P. BetaTube<br>
2021-2022<br>
Died due to an owner not wanting to host the site anymore<br>
"This site dead lmao"
<br><br>
Fun fact: During the last minutes in the discord server, i just destroyed it lmaoooo. I deleted a lot of the channels and all the messages were lost as a result. They were useless and just spammed, but it was funny xD. hwilliams8548 just gave everyone admin access to the discord which is why i was able to do it that easily. every member had it.<br>
<br>
Thx 4 reading this zad blog honoring the death of BetaTube.

<summary>100th Blog | 4/07/2022 3:20 AM</summary>
We did it guys. I have officially made 100 blogs. This is an amazing moment in human history. I wonder how I have made more blogs within 1 year here than people have within 7 years. Yes, there are some that are basically shitposts, but I am still surprised lmaooooo. I would like to take a moment to see how far away we are from other goals still to just show how easily I got here xD.<br><br>
1 Year Paint Anniversary - 6 Days<br>
1st Blog Anniversary - 2 Months and 2 Days<br><br>
Yep. I still have a little bit before my first blog anniversary or my first year passes. I have quite literally gone beyond HullBreach blog creation pace at this point. I am basically the most active so far xD. That is crazy in my opinion. If I can do it, what are y'all waiting on start making cool blogs like mine. They totally don't consist of mostly shitposts xD.<br><br>
Also, I now have the 4 star author badge as of you reading this. Maybe I can get gold not too long from now xD. We will see how many blogs I have by the time its the first blog anniversary for me. I mean I did good so far so I should be very good by then assuming I don't lose entire motivation to do anything (we'll see how well this ages). Thanks for reading this blog and i am out for now also drop liek if you want.

<summary>One Year on 3DSPaint | 4/13/2022 1:41 AM</summary>
Hello everyone! It has been one year since I joined 3DSPaint. Within such a short time, I have basically taken over the platform which wasn't hard as it is basically dead (only other person that isn't a mod that is near my level I think would be Draconid_Jo or AnimaBoy). I am glad to be able to serve this amazing community.<br>
<p1 style="color:gold">-------------</p1><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Paint Achievements</summary>
I have done many things while on 3DSPaint. I will list all those things below.<br><br>
Badges:<br>
4 Star Author Badge<br>
3 Star Courier Badge<br>
6 Star Socialite Badge<br>
5 Star Poster Badge<br>
OverlorDS Badge<br>
Yortzee Badge<br><br>
Blogs Featured:<br>
Quite a lot but im too lazy to check<br><br>
Things I am working on:<br>
Golden Author Badge<br>
Golden Courier Badge<br>
Golden Socialite Badge (probably gonna be done very soon)<br>
Golden Poster Badge (this will likely outlive the Wak-A-Skunk as taking the longest bc its 2022)<br>
Wak-A-Skunk Badge<br>
Minco Says Badge<br>
Golden Artist Badge (does it even exist still?)<br><br>
There have been quite a lot of things I have done and some I plan to do eventually.
</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Other Stuff</summary>
I have also grown my platforms outside of 3DSPaint. YouTube has especially grown. I will list things below.<br><br>
Grown Platforms:<br>
YouTube - 118 Subs, 13k+ Views, over 420 Videos<br>
Discord - 45 Members, 2 Allies<br>
Reddit - 20 Followers, 20K Karma, 200+ Posts, Multiple Subreddits<br>
Twitter - 15 Followers, 500+ Tweets<br>
Odysee - 12 LBC, 10 Followers, nearly half my YT videos reuploaded<br>
Sites I made - Blog Site, ATTU Site<br><br>
There is likely some more that I missed, but idc. Its pretty cool overall xD. Yes there is sneaky advertising in my posts. We do a 'lil trolling :trol:</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Future</summary>
As time goes on, I suspect that my empire will grow and that I may eventually be able to become the CCP. Jokes aside, 3DSPaint is very amazing and I won't stop using it until it shuts down and I would maybe even consider making a classic version (similar to VidLii but for this site) if I really need to, but can't really do much of a DSi compatible site that isn't horrible.
</details>
<p1 style="color:gold">-------------</p1><br>
Thanks for reading this blog :D<br>
I will probably see if I can become the most active paint user assuming I haven't done that already or gotten very close (other than HB who works on the site ofc along with the 2 active mods on the site).<br><br>
Also, yes, I know we managed to all get 10 people in a chatroom and even HullBreach joined for which I am glad happened. Best for last part of the blog lmaooooooo. K thx bye 4 now.

<summary>Will SDK Become Alive Again? Likely Outcomes | 5/23/2022 10:49 PM</summary>
As you likely know if you started being active around June 2021 like I did, 3DSPaint basically went through an entire phase of revival. It went from ded in 2021, to alive, and now in 2022 it is more alive but more dead than it was in September 2021-Feburary 2022. It has been a lot better than at that point I will admit. I've been making my 3 million blogs as usual and managing the groups. 3DSPaint and DSiPaint do get an advantage as these sites are so much related to the older consoles that they have the names of them in the title.<br><br>
My guess is that it will probably soon actually have more than 5 people here at best again. Summer is almost here (if not already for some people) and I bet I could try to get more people on the site too. By that time, people will actually have free time. Also, considering not long ago we got 10 ppl including HullBreach himself, it likely will happen soon. I do have a few possible outcomes though.<br>
-------------<br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Revives Itself Multiple Times</summary>
We are almost in the summer so people will have free time as I have said before. Also as I have said, this site is designed for the DSi/3DS so that also is another benefit. Sudomemo and Kaeru would be a good place to see if we could get more people on the site as they are specifically designed for the DSi (Sudomemo) and 3DS (Sudomemo and Kaeru).<br><br>
It already has happened at least once. In April 2021, it was basically dead as you probably know. Sure there was some exceptions, but it was mostly dead for the most part. In June 2021, it started being more active. In October 2021-Feburary 2022, it was probably the most active it had been in a while. I often saw people online all the time and basically no one was offline during the weekends except maybe 1-2 people.<br><br>
This is probably the most likely. I think we would have to do major improvements to make the SDK Community not eventually die out no matter how many cycles of people we have, but this will likely be a good idea. We already are getting a major step in the right direction with a mobile app. Now I wonder if we could create a homebrew app for the 3DS and DSi. Sounds useless, but if it is homebrew then people will be able to more easily find the place as they would be searching around for new things such as mods or homebrew. Probably could do the same for the Wii even. Perhaps an offline mode for painting would work as well. Also, we could probably use memory much more effectively on the DSi specifically.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Dies Suddenly</summary>
This is the second most likely thing to happen. Running the site obviously isn't cheap either. There is the option of clearing things that would likely never be accessed ever again, but this wouldn't be a good idea as it may actually remove a lot of the reason to use the site for people who haven't been here in a while. ADs clearly aren't making any money (didn't it not even get a few cents?), although paying money to HB to advertise sounds like a good idea.<br><br>
Now, if this does happen we have the discord server. I would at least hope DSiPaint outlives 3DSPaint (it already has since day one, but I think you know what I mean) mainly because it is probably a tiny bit easier to host the DSi version compared to the 3DS version. Ofc tho, there wouldn't be much hope with that if that were the case.
</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Takes over every single other website</summary>
This would be what we hope for, but probably won't happen. I think you already could guess why it would not happen though so I won't need to explain it.</details>
-------------<br>
Thanks for reading this blog I guess. Finally a blog that isn't filler.

<summary>The Act Man vs QuantumTV - War lol | 7/04/2022 2:24 AM</summary>
The Act Man and QuantumTV have been going at it for a little while now. I shall give my opinion on the whole situation along with some explanation of it a little bit. For legal reasons, please do not send 74 nukes to anyone's houses. K read the blog now.<br>
----------<br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Basic Recap</summary>
QuantumTV got mad over a joke, he tried to take it down, The Act Man made a video, QuantumTV big mad, QuantumTV actually known now, Act Man loses monetization, Act Man tries to commit copyright strike, people still somehow found a way to defend that</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">QuantumTV</summary>
Quantum has done so much shit. The main thing I will be focusing on is the copyright abuse that it seems he has done. While yes he has been a lil bit racist/homophobic, why should I even care? Also ban evasion, but there's also basically no one who cares about that. He once even called The Act Man's mother too.
<br><br>
One of the main things he did was taking down video criticism to QuantumTV's Elden Ring video. Basically, he would strike them. Striking them is almost always wrong even if it were just a straight up reupload because everyone loses the opportunity to make money including yourself. This is where he started to get really known for being stupid as shit. He has done it a decent bit before too but to smaller creators. I don't have to do anymore explaining for it I bet.
<br><br>
This is very short because it's pretty self-explanatory. Don't need to explain that abusing copyright to silence criticism is wrong and illegal.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">The Act Man</summary>
At first, he was very reasonable. He made a <a href="https://youtu.be/k1OWLq2dO2c">video on Quantum</a> and it was considered good. It was perfectly fair and all. He eventually made a joke on <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1534954533536735232">Twitter about how he would be doxxing and harrassing members</a> which is obviously a joke because he then mentions that a new TOS (that doesn't exist ofc), allows him to do that. YouTube got mad over that and I understand there.
<br><br>
So far he seems good. So what happened? Well he said in DMs that he wanted to strike Tommy C for <a href="https://youtu.be/w6YKEComtfs">this video</a>.
<br><br>
So yea, this is not a good look for The Act Man. He pretty much nearly screwed himself already. But if that wasn't enough, there is some more. The Act Man constantly is now begging YouTube to "enforce their policies" but why in the hell would you want that if you get de-monetized unfairly? I'd rather just them not enforce anything against either person at that point. He probably made decent money off of it and would still be making a lot if he wasn't de-monetized. So why in the hell would he want it?
<br><br>
Also, he keeps making it seem like "OMG enforce your guidelines" when it's clearly a cancellation. Now does QuantumTV deserve it for copyright abuse especially? Yes absolutely. But what he is trying to do is pretty stupid. It's funny too because he literally didn't have to do much of anything to win this one and yet he is fucking it up. All the Act Man had to do was:
<br><br>
1. Make the Quantum video<br>
2. Complain about YouTube<br>
3. Not want to strike Tommy C's video and admitting to wanting to in DMs<br>
4. Move to Odysee (optional)
<br><br>
Really it was that simple this entire time. Due to Quantum simply copyright abusing he could have won just off of that alone. And after all the other stuff, it's surprising he could mess up this badly. Odds are, he has at least dealt with one other person that wasn't as bad but still annoying like QuantumTV is. The Act Man is in the right for the most part, but him trying to strike the video was stupid and trying to disguise it as "enforcing their policies" instead of basically being like "yea this is pretty much a cancellation" is scummy.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Final Opinion</summary>
So what is the final verdict? Well The Act Man is obviously the better person here and QuantumTV is much worse, but The Act Man doesn't exactly have the best arguments either. He is very close to winning but if he keeps fucking things up like this, he will win but at a major cost.
<br><br>
QuantumTV deserves all of the backlash he is receiving due to this drama. He should have it happened long ago, but they weren't at a size to actually be able to do something.</details>
----------<br>
But yea that's my opinions on the QuantumTV and Act Man drama. Kthxbye
<blockquote>Note: everything said here is just what I found and what is my personal opinion. Please take everything I say with a grain of salt as I might not be 100% accurate. Also, the DMs are no longer seen in here like they were supposed to be in the original because the discord link no longer exists sadly.

Ok everyone since you don't listen when I'm nice, I'm going to get mean
<br><br>
Reacting to messages with a clown, a skull, or a nerd face isn't funny. It's not cool, it's not interesting, it's annoying.
<br><br>
These 3 emojis in particular aren't funny, they're RUDE. We as staff work hard to keep this place safe, and to have you all constantly react to our messages with mean emojis makes me FURIOUS!
<br><br>
STOP reacting to our meesages with rude emojis. They do NOTHING but make you look really, really stupid
<br><br>
It shows you have no rebuttals to our arguments, so you have to use juvvenile tactice paramount to terrorism in order to stop us from being able to speak our truth.
<br><br>
FROM NOW ON, IF YOU REACT WITH ANY MEAN EMOJIS, I AM WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN!
<br><br>
IF YOU ARE A SERIAL REACTOR, YOUR USERNAME IS GOING TO A GOOGLE DOC. AT THE END OF THE MONTH, I WILL TAKE THIS DOC TO THE APPROPRATE AUTHORITIES FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE AND ARREST YOU!

This is your ONLY warning. Tread carefully...</details>

<summary>3DS/Wii U Removes E-Shop Card Support | 8/29/2022 11:24 PM</summary>
We are almost in September which means we are closer to the e-shop closure for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii U. As a way to make the removal effective, there is a new update for the 3DS and Wii U. 11.16 and 5.5.6 are the new updates which is essentially just updates for the coffin again especially for the Wii U.<br><br>
Redownloading games have no set shut down date and considering the Wii/DSi is still online (it came back after a few months of downtime recently), it probably will be at least another decade. I will explain how you can add money until 2023 when you wouldn't be able to spend anything left you have outside of the Nintendo Switch.<br><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">How to Transfer Funds to 3DS/Wii U Currently</summary>
It's pretty easy to do this luckily. Just do things exactly and you will be good.
<br><br>
1. Make Nintendo Account and NNID if you do not have one yet<br>
1a. 3DS Checking: Go to NNID Settings on newest firmware<br>
1b. Wii U Checking: Link it to a user and see if the NNID icon is on the icon now<br>
1c. Make Nintendo Account on Website (Switch is unable to do this as far as I know)<br>
2. Link Your Nintendo Account and NNID (must have exact same birthdays so be careful)<br>
3. Add Funds on either <a href="https://nintendo.com/">Nintendo's Website</a> or the Nintendo Switch's E-Shop<br>
4. Go to 3DS or Wii U e-shop<br>
5. Find the game and purchase it<br>
6. Install and Play
<br><br>
I REPEAT, MAKE SURE THE BIRTHDAYS ARE THE EXACT SAME FOR NNIDS AND NINTENDO ACCOUNTS OR ELSE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LINK THEM
</details>
Now as for some final stuff, I predict that online would last from 2026-2030 at best but idk. There is no announcement date just yet for it though so that is good. If you have not done so just yet, I would likely recommend homebrewing your 3DS with <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/" style="color:red">this guide here</a>. As for not being able to redownload games anymore either, it would likely end in 2035-2040. Other than that, RIP 3DS/Wii U and thanks for reading.

<summary>Sigma Male Grindset E1 | 9/13/2022 1:31 AM</summary>
I will be teaching you how to become a true sigma male. You can also become a Sigma Female I guess, but we know which is more based. This episode will be more so focused on the basics. E2 will be focused on other parts of it.
<hr>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold;">BASIC SIGMA RULES</p1><br><br>
There are some basic rules to know about being a Sigma Male.<br><br>
1. Your Favorite Movies must be American Psycho and Fight Club<br>
2. Anyone Telling you that you missed the point by idolizing people in the movie are just not sigma males and they can't see the power you have.<br>
3. Its hard to go back from being a sigma once you start the grindset. Idk why you would want to anyways though.<br>
4. No you do not have autism or whatever, you are a based and redpilled Sigma Male<br><br>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO ACT LIKE A SIGMA</p1><br><br>
You can't just say that you are a sigma male and be done obviously. You need to make your entire personality about being a sigma. Sigma PFP, No Bio or a Sigma One, and Sigma Behavior.<br><br>
1. Basics described above<br>
2. No talking to Women >:(<br>
3. Make sure to never touch grass. Grass isn't going to solve anything, it only makes you stop being a Sigma.<br>
4. Watch American Psycho and Fight Club at least 4 times a day each.<br>
5. There is no Sigma Community<br><br>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold;">FINAL NOTES</p1><br><br>
Overall it isn't that hard to be a sigma. That is just the basics though. If you for some reason want to leave now, get out while you still can. Other than that, GG well played.
<hr>
Well there is one more thing. Telling people you are a Sigma Male will defeat the purpose of you doing it because we do not actively tell people. Hell most of us don't call each other by such a fucking cringe name. Ok now we are actually done with this.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Sigma Male Grindset E2 | 9/13/2022 1:56 AM</summary>
Ok so you've learned the basics so now what? You may think you've already done it just now but there is much to learn. There are many things you can do to progress the sigma grindset further.
<hr>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold">IMPORTANT QUOTES</p1><br><br>
"Don't be the solution to the problem, BE the problem" - Sigma Character 1<br>
"My biggest flex is that I'm no one's favorite person" - Based Sigma Lord 42<br>
"I like my women like my taxes, I evade them" - Cool Sigma Dude 34<br>
"You can tell somebody is lying to you when they tell you something and it is not true" - Le Sigma Gamr<br>
"'let people enjoy things' ok I enjoy critical analysis and being a hater" - SigmaLordTheSequel<br>
"idc if you didn't find it funny, im always the target audience of my jokes" - DeezTheGamr<br>
"Another image of this fucking guy with some bullshit written on it" - AC<br>
"Fuck Causal Racism, We're Going Ranked" - Me literally as of making this blog for some reason<br><br>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold">SIGMA MALE MEMES</p1><br><br>
You can make your own but I recommend checking sites like Twitter to just steal them (Sigmas don't mind it).<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/shitpostbale">Sigma meme account here</a><br><br>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold">SIGMA YOUTUBE CHANNELS</p1><br><br>
There are none. As I said, no one actively says they are a sigma male because otherwise that would defeat the purpose and you then sound very cringe. Never tell people your sigma ways unless they are interested.
<br><br>
Also there are no Sigma Odysee channels either. Not even Sigma Twitch streams (big sad). Surprising there are even Sigma Twitter accounts because you'd expect there to be none. There is very few Sigma Reddit accounts that exist and a total of 0 Sigma Instagram or Facebook accounts.
<hr>
Hope you enjoyed this episode of the Sigma Grindset. You are one step closer to being a true Sigma Male. Some people may wonder how they can make Sigma their whole personality without it being entirely cringe. Basically just play it off as one huge meme yourself.

<summary>Very Based Member Appreciation Day 2022 | 9/15/2022 10:59 AM</summary>
Hello. I figured I would start work on the member appreciation blog that I planned for having in two days. Every Member will be in spoiler boxes (I will go through the main 3 so this thing doesn't go for years) so you can easily read them. With that out the way, enjoy reading.
<hr>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Draconid_Jo</summary>
Joashu is quite a good friend on 3DSPaint. He's one of the first members I actually saw here other than Weeeheep and others. He's taught me quite a decent bit especially about Pokemon.
<br><br>
Without him, I also think the site would have been mostly dead. Him becoming a blogmin/pollmin probably helped the site a decent bit as blogs would be approved much faster which not long ago surprising, took forever (I am talking days or weeks, not a few hours-1 day on average). Also he's just overall a good friend. He actually has intelligence too unlike some other member who disabled their account after backlash but I won't give any names and thats not what this blog is about anyways.
</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">crocodile</summary>
crocodile is probably the only user who can consistently remain active. Even when the site was essentially fucked because of inactivity, we still found a way to do stuff.
<br><br>
For those wondering why Paint could have been fucked earlier this year had it not gained activity with the summer again, there were basically like 5 active people. Me, crocodile, and a few others along with blogmins/pollmins somewhat on, but they were mostly in the SDK server. I remember there was like 3 groups and 6 ppl at best active. DC Empire, Draconid_Jo's group, and like one other I can't remember the name of.
<br><br>
Also, we would have a ton of fun trolling each other in the profile comments. After all, literally no one was online so we just did whatever. Now ofc we still somewhat abided by the rules (aka no spamming the nword or whatever), but still. While the site was dead, it was arguably the 2nd best time on Paint. The best time was when it was so active with like at least 6 groups constantly getting notifcations to the point it could have a whole over 15 minute video with stuff like trolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/GDesWUmkkfI">Here if someone wants it for some reason</a>.
<br><br>
Another thing though is that crocodile helped me with CSS for groups. Without him, I don't think I'd be anywhere near the level I ended up being. I'd argue that he actually somewhat got me interested into HTML/CSS at least to some extent. I would likely still be trying to learn the basics of HTML/CSS if I would even know it without him.
</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Weeeheep</summary>
Weeeheep is a pretty good friend ofc, but he's also been somewhat active whenever he can. This is gonna be shorter than the others since its pretty easy to sum it up but he also taught me how to do snaking in MKDS. Before he helped me, I would just spam the D-pad and wonder why it doesn't work. With his help, I was able to actually do decent in MKDS. Later I went on to do stuff like attempting to 3 star the Mission Mode/Grand Prix which as of now I am still working on. But yea that's pretty much it for him as it doesn't need that many words to explain.

<summary>Sigma Male Grindset E3 | 9/16/2022 10:48 PM</summary>
As you know, Sigmas are Sigma Bales because we say so. There are some more rules you need to know though about them. This will be the last blog in the series unless something new is made.
<hr>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold">HOW TO SPOT SIGMAS</p1>
<br><br>
As you know, people don't just say they are sigmas. So how do we even figure out random people are sigmas without seeming like a stalker? Well we do exactly that. Make sure that they are sigma by:<br>
1. They dont claim they are sigmas despite acting very sigma<br>
2. They own a sigma bale account on twitter (works online only)<br>
3. If offline, make sure they make fun of sigmas as that is a sigma male move.
<br><br>
It seems dumb to make fun of sigmas, but people who know they are sigmas and make it blatantly obvious by alerting other sigmas need to be made fun of as that is a non-sigma male move. Remember: there is no sigma community.
<br><br>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold">MAKING FUN OF SIGMAS</p1>
<br><br>
To expand on making fun of them, you need to make fun of people who unironically call themselves true sigma males as that isn't sigma. But also you need to convince yourself that you are just a regular human except when you shouldn't. If a doctor diagnoses you with autism instead of recognizing you as a based sigma male, then they are not sigma males/females. The world would be better if only sigma males/females could be doctors (CLICKBAITN'T).
<br><br>
I think I should also highlight the differences in class if you don't already know.
<br><br>
Beta Males = Cringe m*n who simp for w*mxn (can go the other way around too, but usually happens with m*n simping for w*mxn)<br>
Alpha Males = They get bitches without simping (or men if they're gay). Many people think people who are just alphas are actually sigmas<br>
Sigma Males = Ignores all women and even men as it is a Migma Sale move. Some people would call them terminally online, but sigmas know they are just sigma bales
<br><br>
Betas are so easy to spot that literally even non-sigmas and other betas can spot them. Alphas are also easy. Sigmas are hard and people actively saying wouldn't be sigma. Its intentionally made like that though so only true sigmas can do it unlike the other two. A lot of people are probably just starting to think sigmas are terminally online (or already think that). That actually isn't really the case.
<br><br>
Terminally online and sigmas are two very distinct things. Sigmas seem terminally online at first, but they only do that to make sure people won't bat an eye and attempt to unsigmafy them. Terminally online betas just do it because they have no life. However these distinctions aren't perfect as people who just became sigmas may seem non-sigma even if they are just at the beginning stages of their life as a sigma.
<br><br>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold">CONCLUSIONS?</p1>
<br><br>
You've basically learned anything you could need to be a true Bigma Sale. Now go become a based gigachad.

So you think its impossible to be gay and homophobic at the same time? Just go onto Twitter and say a slightly right-leaning opinion and mention that you are gay.
<br><br>
Congrats. You are officially homophobic and gay.

<summary>Art Competition - DC vs Yeuron | 9/21/2022 12:27 AM</summary>
Ok so we are now on October 5th. Who won? Well I got literally every SDKPaint vote. Yeuron didn't get one vote.<br>
As for Sudomemo, it depends.
<br><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">DC's Stars</summary>
47 Yellow Stars<br>
46 Green Stars<br>
10 Red Stars<br>
103 Total Stars</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Yeuron's Stars</summary>
170 Yellow Stars<br>
12 Green Stars<br>
1 Red Star<br>
183 Total Stars</details>
So who won Sudomemo? Its either go by how valuable the stars are or go by how many there are. In terms of how valuable, I won easily because most were Green/Red. In terms of how many, Yeuron won. Granted this means either I won (if we allow both factors) or its a tie.
<hr>
Outdated:<br>
So me and @Yeuron will be holding an art competition on Sudomemo/SDKPaint. Real quote from @DCTheGamr "lol im gonna win i think"
<hr>
<p1 style="font-weight:bold">RULES:</p1><br>
1. We can only use Flipnote Studio on DSi as we both have that<br>
2. No stealing from others for obvious reasons<br>
3. 2 Weeks Only (ends october 5th)
<br><br>
Its pretty simple rules so lets see who's gonna win. I'll drop the video that I make onto my Art Channel. Winner gets nothing except maybe free clout or some shit idk (views maybe).

<summary>(satirical) DC Empire Constitution | 9/23/2022 11:12 PM</summary>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">The Constitution of DC Empire</summary>
-------The Constitution of Da Official Digital Cheese Empire-------
<br><br>
We the people reserve the right to free speech so long as it does not break SpaceHey TOS. We the people also reserve the right to shitpost whenever we want in bulletin boards. We reserve the right to bear arms against enemies. We shall defend ourselves from a corrupt government. We shall form alliances and partners.
<br><br>
1. Racism, Transphobia, Homophobia, and Sexism Restrictions<br>
We the people prohibit racism, transphobia, homophobia, and sexism. We do allow edgy jokes, but actual versions of these crimes shall be charged with jail time. This also applies to the same people we usually should protect. All races, sexes, and other types of people shall be treated equally under the law. Saying the n-word is ok assuming Barack Obama gives you the n-word pass.<br>
2. Piracy<br>
Piracy is not allowed in the discord server. Making memes about stuff like Nintendo being pissed at a 30 year old game getting pirated despite being touched is ok, but helping out or encouraging piracy is against the rules. Nothing major will happen other than being told to not promote piracy would normally be there. If you actively help out with piracy, you will suffer the consequences after being caught 3 times.<br>
3. Advertisement<br>
Advertising is allowed in the bulletin boards. If you made a resource that someone is looking for, advertising that is legal. If they ask for you to mass DM them your property, you are allowed to do so. Randomly advertising stuff outside of bulletin boards will get you warnings, DM advertisements will get you temporarily suspended, and dangerous links for either will result in a ban such as gitxhub.com instead of github.com<br>
4. Alliances/Partnerships<br>
Alliances/Partnershps are allowed to happen assuming both parties agree to the alliance/partnership. Upon becoming an ally/partner, you don't have to have the same rules, but you can not randomly declare war without either both parties agreeing to it or first removing your discord as an ally. You can also become an ally as a cross-platform thing such as having a subreddit become an ally/partner with a discord server. You may also put r/DigitalCheese as the ally instead of the discord as they are both the same entity. This party may terminate your alliance/partnership at any time if we feel it is needed or you would like to become an enemy.<br>
5. Enemies<br>
To become an enemy, you simply have to DM this party and then say you would like to declare war. As stated previously, you can not be an ally/partner already without both people agreeing it is time to go to war. We will usually not declare war against you without your attention. Upon becoming an enemy, you can not be an ally/partner until the war is won/lost or until you declare peace.
<br><br>
Upon joining Da Official Digital Cheese Empire, you agree to these laws and promise to not break them. You also promise to be a useful soldier by being somewhat active in this empire or getting people to join the empire. We can edit this document at anytime if it is needed. If you would like to change something, you can change it if 2/3 of the server that isn't suspended agrees on it. This is an official DC Empire document that was made on April 27th, 2022 at 11:58PM and will be established on April 28th, 2022 at 12AM

<summary>Nintendo Shutting Down 3DS/Wii U Photo Sharing | 10/14/2022 11:08 PM</summary>
On October 25th, Nintendo will be removing 3DS/Wii U Photo Sharing to Twitter/Facebook. How will you easily upload photos now you may be asking? Well its easy. This method works for both 3DS and Wii U.<br>
-----<br>
1. Get to wherever your screenshot is (Wii U only part)<br>
2. Login to 3DSPaint if you aren't already.<br>
3. Go to your settings then image uploads.<br>
4. Select Photos (up to 3 and it supports any/all)<br>
5. Share them when needed<br>
5a. If paint, use [FIGURE X]<br>
5b. If other website, copy the image link or download and reupload.<br>
-----<br>
Hope this helps you :D<br>
Not sure how long Art Academy Home Studio video uploading to YT will last.
<blockquote>the website is still useful, no other way to share photos on 3DS/Wii U otherwise as of now</blockquote>

<summary>How to Beat "_ I'm Gay" Poll | 10/19/2022 1:32 AM</summary>
So as you know in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230202062348/https://3dspaint.com/poll/view.php?id=24647">this poll</a>, it would seem as if you are forced to admit you are gay. I mean, every option would seemingly say that right? Yes, No, and Maybe. However there is actually a way to win while also still playing said game. This will require some mental gymnastics here, so hold on for a minute.
<br><br>
If you select Yes or No, you are gay according to the poll. Obviously if you are following this guide, this isn't the outcome you want. So how do we win? Well there is a 3rd option which is "Maybe". Maybe would still imply that you might be gay right? Well not exactly. "Yes, I'm Gay" is you saying you're gay as if you're answering the question of if you're gay and "No, I'm Gay" would imply that someone asked you if you were straight or bisexual.
<br><br>
However, saying "Maybe, I'm Gay" would still imply there is a chance you are in fact not gay. Therefore, you reply maybe because it implies that you could actually be straight. And thats how you barely beat this poll. Granted even this makes you sound gay, but if you want to do some mental gymnastics, you do not in fact have to be gay to answer the poll.

So »DC Empire« has been getting upgrades. CSS should be in widescreen now so yay. Btw, this means PC will look cool lol. Changed the background and plan to work on it more (also for 3DS and up, theres transparent backgrounds now)
<br><br>
Some downgrades: CSS Names were mostly destroyed and the few still there weren't working. Until I get my name working, no CSS names.
<br><br>
I'll try to make custom badges for profiles. 256x256 looks too big on DSi even after changing width so that sucks. I should be able to make them work in 32x32 or 64x64

<summary>200 3DSPaint Blogs | 11/9/2022 8:16 PM</summary>
Why hello everyone. Today I would like to announce that I am officially at 200 SDKPaint blogs. This is quite the huge milestone, but it isn’t going to get me a badge just yet because that’s the 250th blog I get 5 star. I might be one of the first people (if not straight up first) to get to 1000 blogs. Yes I know most of my blogs are just advertisements, but I don’t really care.
<br><br>
Now I would like to say a few things about how I will be doing blogs in the future. As you know, SDKPaint will likely only have a few years left and even if it survives a long time, it will be completely dead by then. However what I will say is that I decided to start archiving all of my blogs on my website (I am unable to link due to temporary rules due to a recent hack).
<br><br>
I will try to make the CSS look a little bit like whatever site I am archiving if I can. 3DSPaint looks like paint, GBATemp would look a bit like Temp, etc. To find my website, go to the link section of my YouTube channel which has the @ of “@DigitalCheese” for those trying to find on YouTube. That or do /DigitalCheese after going to youtube.com

<summary>Return of CSS Custom Names | 11/11/2022 2:58 AM</summary>
Hello everyone, I have amazing news! CSS names are about to make a major return to Paint after the Paint hack (check Rlad116 blog). I will give the CSS to everyone so y'all can edit, but it will allow you to do whatever. Verification badges will be given in my groups if I feel its deserved. Otherwise, just use the CSS in your own group and change the "/member?id=150961" to whatever your profile link is but without the "https://3dspaint.com" part.
<br><br>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">CSS</summary>
a[href="/member?id=150961"]::before {<br>
content:"TDK-Emperor "!important;<br>
color: orange!important<br>
}<br>
a[href="/member?id=150961"] {<br>
color: lime!important<br>
}<br>
a[href="/member?id=150961"]::after {<br>
color: gold;<br>
content: " [Owner] " url(/images/upload_gallery/15929.jpg)!important<br>
}
</details>
<br>
Feel free to edit the CSS to be whatever you like. This works on DSi and 3DS as well, but the checkmark looks low quality for DSi/O3DS users. Enjoy this CSS :D
<br><br>
I would usually have CSS name comments, but those are no longer available after the * symbol was banned from CSS so no more comments.

<summary>Merging of the Anti-TikTok Union and the Anti-TikTok Order | 11/14/2022 9:20 AM</summary>
Hello everyone. I'm here with more news for things I've been working on. At 2am in the morning, I decided to merge the ATTU and ATTO into one community (simply called ATTO, but there are some left over things from ATTU). This was partly done due to it being essentially pointless to continue ATTU especially with the reputation it ended up gaining unlike ATTO. Also, ATTO had more members even if it was non-existant basically. I will be using the ATTO as the general for Anti-TikTok activities other than ATTL as a result.
<br><br>
If you would like to check the website out, see below.<br>
https://atto.neocities.org
<br><br>
Hope this helps you out. ATTO on the dc-blog Neocities website has been removed for it being useless and now we will use an entirely separate link so W. The site still has lots of work to do but feel free to check it out. If you help with research, you will get credit on the website btw :D

<summary>DC's Blog Site v4.0 | 11/21/2022 1:13 PM</summary>
Hello everyone! We are officially on v4 of the website that I own. I should be attempting some major changes to the layout and other cool stuff soon. I wanna actually teach myself it so I won't be using sadgrl.online's layout maker like I did last time. I will also be attempting to have two bars and pages may vary with how the bars look.
<br><br>
Another thing to note is that I will have a separate area for navigation due to bar size limits (as there is more pages, it causes issues). A simple navbar then maybe at the bottom or on a separate page a full navigation directly to every page on the site should do good. Obviously this stuff will take quite a while but v4 will likely be focusing on basic stuff like making HTML/CSS more optimized so it both saves space and I can do more with it eventually.
<hr>
This is how it currently looks now:<br>
(search old designs, there is no longer an archive available here)
<br><br>
As you can tell, it looks pretty cool. Archives of all 200+ 3DSPaint blogs that I made will be up there eventually (but it will take a while since I have to manually transfer everything and make sure shit doesn't seem weird). Other than that, it should be pretty quick. Perhaps I will be doing Java Script eventually. Not much else for me to say so thx for reading and if you want, check out the website below. If I can, I will make it work on DSi and O3DS (it barely works on N3DS at least).

<summary>ATTO Dev Updates | 11/25/2022 2:28 PM</summary>
Updated the Developer page on the ATTO website to have the new layout and add the devs that also helped (aka i made the site, Mire owns it and helps with videos/discord, ww5z created the 2nd server). I will finally be able to start actually working on the website now that everything there is in place. Expect to see some cool stuff soon ;D
<br><br>
If you want to help, it would be nice to see if we could get some research for things like the dangerous trends more easily. That would be the biggest help to the ATTO website (perhaps something like a YouTube video on how it affects you with actually good research). If we find a video you make that we like, we will ask before we randomly just embed the post/video on the website for obvious reasons.

<summary>DC Empire - CSS Updates Yet Again | 12/8/2022 11:56 PM</summary>
Hello fellow DC Empire members! I have yet again did a major update to DC Empire. If you would like to see it, just go to the group. Search up "DC Empire" in groups and you should find it. 65 members and counting. Also I like this autosave feature so thx @HullBreach
<br><br>
Finally before going, I will be doing major updates to the TDK CSS soon too. Will probably make it a cool red theme
<blockquote>i have no clue how i gained so many members in less than 3 months. went from 65 to 80 very quickly. 81 will probably happen (again) by my 2nd year on here.</blockquote>

It may even have more so that would be cool.

Either way, the website is getting updates yet again. Should be pretty cool.

<summary>250 Blogs Soon | 12/13/2022 2:28 AM</summary>
Holy shit I think I might barely get to 250 blogs by the end of the year. I will have gotten a 5 star author badge before most people even get 3 star. I will have a hard time with 6 star and I'm gonna focus on moving a lot of this stuff from here to my website after I finish doing it. Either way, I will be having those archives for my profile soon.
<br><br>
Another thing, it will likely have buttons for each specific year eventually so that way it isn't instantly cluttered. Goddamn just the archive main-page will be nearly 200kb eventually I bet. To think I'm still good with just 1GB of storage via Neocities. Honestly W. As for images, those are harder but I will try to have those working directly on Neocities (though compression might be used). If I can't, it will be on Imgur to free space up.
<br><br>
Either way, things will be very exciting. As for the website, you can check it out at <p1 style="color:gold">dc-blog.neocities.org</p1>

If I see you in TDK, I will kick you from DC Empire. If you aren't in TDK, I will get you there soon.
<br><br>
I also saw some of the groups for DC Empire that could be TDK colonies were dead links anyways or pretty much useless because the site is more broken than Paint like BitView. Other than that, nothing major done lol.

Elon moosk haters malding. These bitches think he banned advertisement of other websites (for Mastodon thats true weirdly but not for the others). Like they just skipped over the fact that it says you can't create accounts specifically for that purpose. Stupid as hell.
<blockquote>More context, people claimed they were somehow going to allow crossposting yet ban just simple advertisements. for a while mastodon.social links were blocked but that was it. everything else functioned as normal and it would be impossible to enforce. manually wouldnt work because not even elon fans would report, automatically with a policy like this would probably have too many false positives. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221218173806/https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/social-platforms-policy">Original policy</a>.

argued with the Pretendo owner himself and he eventually just gave up despite it being pretty clear it would be impossible to do something like this manually or automatically so even with elon its probably something else lol. elon musk haters VS elon musk dick-riders, who would win the clown contest?</blockquote>

One last thing, might make atto.neocities.org be replaced as the TDK website. If TikTok gets banned where I live then I won't be able to help anymore with the movement bc it would be banned where I live. Hope they actually ban it. I would replace the ATTO website as the TDK website because ATTO is basically only for the Anti-TikTok Order whereas TDK is a gaming clan I actively work on and won't stop probably for a long time.

<summary>10 Blogs Away From 250 | 12/25/2022 10:58 PM</summary>
Hello everyone! I have great news. I am only 10 blogs away from 250 blogs, most of which are barely not able to be considered spam. Yes we finally almost did it. Watch as I fail at 249.
<br><br>
After I finish, I will be mass porting everything to my website which is https://dc-blog.neocities.org so feel free to check it out. As a result, expect me to not make blogs for a loooooooooong time unless I can get the archives done fast as fuck.
<br><br>
I expect that the file sizes will have a chance at being ridiculously high at some point. I have to figure out JS buttons to make them function like they do on paint soon so yea (a lot of blogs I made used them).

<summary>5 Blogs Away From Paints Legendary 250 Blogs | 12/27/2022 2:34 PM</summary>
Hello fellow emperors, it is me (DCTheGamr). Today I would like to announce that I am only 5 blogs away as of me writing this blog to the 250 mark. We are finally almost there, 250 blogs. God damn less than two years and I've already written mountains of content for this site alone. Now I gotta transfer them all over somehow. Damn this isn't gonna be easy but whatever lol.
<br><br>
If a blog features stuff like album covers, i will remove the images as I believe it will be required so I don't get sued (after all, im putting it on my own website so i dont wanna risk it). However I will try replacing those images with something else like my PFP here.
<br><br>
Now that I think about it, Neocities gives me 50GB and up to 30 sites if I pay $5 monthly (or 60 USD yearly) so if I did that, I would have actual space for all my files and other stuff really easily. I might actually just do that or get $100 BTC and pay for it that way (that would remove the need for subscriptions which is nice).

Whatever though, we are close now so see you there. PS: I'm catching up to @HullBreach now. After I do the archive, I could easily start doing this again and without making blogs that need effort as long as they don't get to the point of just fucking spam. Though I'd have to make one nearly everyday for it to be possible to get to 500 in 2023 (and I wanna actually archive them right as I finish so less spam blogs).

<summary>Steam should give free games | 12/27/2022 8:28 PM</summary>
Steam would easily once again kill Epic Games if they started giving certain games for free for a period of time. Like fr imagine getting the godlike games you can find on steam such as COD World at War without using the worse launcher. Steam would become even more of a top G.

<summary>DCE and TDK Name CSS | 12/27/2022 8:43 PM</summary>
I will consider returning custom name CSS on groups for the average member. We have a much easier time with ranks/important paint members as I can simply give them a checkmark. However you will be unable to get an icon before your name or multiple times. You also can't have 4 colored names as of now, but I might try to get animated names working for specific people like myself.
<br><br>
Either way, comment the details of the names you want. Use the format below.
<hr>
<center>FORMAT:</center>
<br><br>
- Before Name + Clantag (if u arent in a clan, TDK is used), Color - Optional
<br><br>
- Color of Default Paint name (transparency isn't allowed) - Required
<br><br>
- After Name, Color - Optional except for checkmarks
<hr>
This should give you an idea of how the system works. I would prefer if you give exact hex values such as #00FF00 but it isn't required. I may consider allowing support for background-colors as well but only if it does not lag DSi or O3DS. If it does, it won't be allowed (if it simply doesn't display, that isn't an issue) in names at all.

<summary>The end of custom PFPs on Paint | 12/27/2022 10:12 PM</summary>
Well guys, its the end of the road. After many years the SDKPaint community is losing its custom PFPs. As said by @GuiedGui on the Leftist-Tachyon account, his free hosting thing ended and URLs or whatever have changed for paint thingy. So unless someone can figure it out to replace his method, it will no longer exist. RIP the very useful application. If you have an account with a custom PFP, then don't delete the account lol.
<br><br>
@Darkness has done custom PFPs like that weirdly so if he can explain then that would be nice. Otherwise as said before, RIP custom PFPs.
<br><br>
Well there is one way but it only applies on pages with custom CSS for specific account so that isn't too useful outside of ur own personal profile. Though if you really wanna do it, use the CSS below.
<br><br>
img.avatar[href="Ur main PFP here"] {content:url(linkHere)!important}
<br><br>
If you don't wanna do that (or u wanna make it actually possible to do whatever), then ye thats not an option.

<summary>250 Blogs | 12/27/2022 10:17 PM</summary>
Great news everyone. We are here to gather around the size of this massive W. Yes I did it, 250 blogs in less than two years. God damn I ain't got a life. I will start work on the archive big-time the moment that the badge decides to be given to me. I expect I will need to get spoiler buttons working soon for a lot of the blogs. Either way, this will be a great achievement in DC history. 500 probably won't be done in 2023, but we'll have to see.

<summary>Sigma Grindset Member 420 Learns HTML Blogs | 1/2/2023 4:06 PM</summary>
I figured out how to make basic HTML buttons which will temporarily replace the ones otherwise used by Paint in the archive unless i figure those out. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>Archive Progress 1 | 1/3/2023 1:08 AM</summary>
Hello everyone! This is just archive progress, I got a ton of blogs im archiving. As you already know 2021 is done but since I figured out HTML buttons, I can do that now too. I will use that as said before and the SwSh rant already uses it.
<br><br>
Images will be a problem because of size/copyright. Size is just compressed with JPEGCompress but copyrighted images will just be entirely replaced with something like the TDK logo or my PFP.

<summary>How to do custom PFP CSS in 2023 | 1/3/2023 11:04 PM</summary>
Due to unfortunate events, the custom profile picture uploader we have been using for years has finally broke. However there is kind of a way to do custom PFPs even after it broke. This guide will explain how to do it via CSS. Note that unless the CSS is applied to the profile, group, blog, or whatever else, it won't display but it means it kinda could work outside of paint if you re-write some of the CSS.
<hr>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Navigator Avatar Changing</summary>
To use it, technically all you have to do is copy and paste the code below.
<br><br>
div.nav_avatar {content:url(New-Image-Here)!important}
<br><br>
"div.nav_avatar" is the element for the avatar icons.
"content:url()!important" is where you put your image. Put the image inside of the () part. I would recommend making it 64x64 at most, maybe 32x32. If your image is hosted via 3DSPaint, you can just remove "http://3dspaint.com" and it will work even on DSi.
<br><br>
This will change it for everyone as a warning and only changes the navigation avatar in profiles, groups, etc. Also the link to your zone will be broken via this technically but thats not a big deal, just go to the home menu first and it will work.</details>
<details>
<summary class="spoiler">Specific Profile Changes</summary>
This is a bit more complicated but it allows changes per person. If they change their PFP, you will have to change the CSS again so unless they never change it or its for yourself in groups, I wouldn't recommend this one.
<br><br>
img.avatar[src="Your-Avatar-Image-Here"] {content:url(New-Image-Here)!important}
<br><br>
Now this will change ur PFP for the group which is very nice, but you have to find where your profile picture is stored. If you need help, I will get that link for you and put it in the CSS for you to copy/paste.
<br><br>
It probably works on profiles as well. I won't personally use this much because its gonna be annoying unless I can figure out how to get it to work for a ranking system in TDK, but feel free to use this for anything you want. Once again would recommend like 64x64 size at most if you want it to work right on DSi.
</details>
<hr>
And thats how you do custom CSS profile pictures even after the PFP uploader broke. I might mess around with it to see if I can get a ranking system going but I'm not sure. I'll probably just use it for my own PFP tbh.
<blockquote>CSS is SDK Community specific. You might have to work on it more to get it working outside of paint.</blockquote>

<summary>Fame in the SDKPaint Server | 1/6/2023 6:43 PM</summary>
So as most of you know, I was banned from the SDKPaint server a few months back. Thanks @Yeuron
<br><br>
I mean that for real because I get to watch the stupidity of members and make fun of it without being able to be easily criticized unless they still actively use this site. That aside, I noticed someone somehow went back far enough to find a 271 day old reddit comment advertising this website for which I have to applaud them for.
<br><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100769_1.jpg">
<br><br>
As you can tell there, this person has gone so far back that you can't even reply to the comment because its archived. This is amazing news. The SDKPaint server still cares about me so damn much that they are out here actually reading reddit names and then seeing this shit and then posting me in the server. Lol you must admit thats dedication (I think they're all secretly fanboys lmao).
<br><br>
Really, think about the effort it takes to be so damn controversial that simply advertising a website like 9 months ago (as of this blog's creation) gets me posted in a server that banned me nearly 6 months ago (as of this blog's creation). Really I thought it was a joke that I'm immortal but god damn its actually serious. I literally can't be defeated lol.
<br><br>
You can ban me, try to make me seem racist (*Yeuron*) but you still can't stop people from at least mentioning me so until you stop, I am kinda still there. Barely, but I live on in the name of the SDKPaint members. I should do some tomfoolery but I don't wanna risk a paint ban lol.
<br><br>
Note: In the archive I will censor the face but not the name of the user.
<blockquote>I kept my promise of censoring the face in the archive. Won't censor name because unless u get the tag somehow, its basically useless (and because u can set custom server names, it might not even be possible to guess their tag).</blockquote>

Honestly did they really just restrict the only slightly active part for bans? Guess so.

<summary>The 1984 Update - Rules/More | 2/11/2023 12:08 PM</summary>
So I have received word that the admins (well more so Star Shadow and maybe Rlad) might find a good reason to terminate me soon. I will warn that we will start being more strict until the admins stop which might be never or be a long time.
<br><br>
For one, profile language made in Hall of Shame will be cleaned up. Swearing still will be there, just not as much. Also I will keep providing images despite the risk of bans, but we will have to see how that goes.
<br><br>
Groups will start being stricter too. All rule violations will be logged warnings, including minor stuff. The punishment is a restriction in the chat (aka i make ur PFP fill the whole screen). We will also change CSS names to be more appropriate if needed.
<br><br>
Whatever is the case though, I will keep fighting for FREEDOM on Paint and we shall not stand for censorship no matter what it takes.
<br><br>
I will end us off with a message. Put it in your profiles if you want to. We will make Paint great again!

Idk but I will give you my male type which is essentially astrology but cool which is a combination of Sigma and Delta male<br>

<summary class="spoiler">Questions 5</summary>
A. If you could get away with one murder in your lifetime without any legal, social, or emotional repercussions, would you kill someone?<br>
Maybe, it depends on who we talking about as very few are ever worthy of the death penalty and the few who are usually commit crimes that deserve a fate much worse such as pedophilia.<br>
<br>
B. What is your first thought when you receive a message on Tumblr, are you excited for the idea of someone from potentially the other side of the world wanting to talk to you or fearful that someone will criticize you?<br>
Well never used Tumblr, but first time using the internet was pretty cool. I could play against 1000s of people on Splatoon and see what they posted on Miiverse. Was pretty fun, would recommend and will do again.<br>
<br>
C. Have you ever looked down on someone because you thought your religious views were superior?<br>
Of course not. I treat all religions equally including the bad ones, therefore i treat them all equally.<br>
<br>
D. Would you rather know everything the universe has to offer but in exchange lose all emotions or remain the way you are now?<br>
Yea no i wanna remain the way I am now. The information is useless if you can't convince anyone of it so unless it also gives me that, why would I pick it? I can fake emotions tho.<br>
<br>
E. If you could live and be healthy without sleeping or eating/drinking, which would you cut out of your life?<br>
No sleep. Eating pizza is fun and so is drinking sprites. But sleep is just gay and cringe. If I could live fine without sleep, i would have an extra few hours in my life to do whatever I wanted. A few extra hours daily isnt much normally, but its a lot over 70 years. 4x365x72=105,120 hours extra I think. Keep in mind thats only 4h which you will likely get way more throughout your life compared to the otherwise few days ur not sleeping for over 24h<br>
<br>
G. Would you rather burn or freeze to death?<br>
Which is less painful and faster? The faster/less painful one I'm taking<br>
<br>
H. If it meant it would solve all world hunger, war, disease and bigotry, would you spend the rest of eternity in Hell?<br>
Yea no. You can end world hunger/disease. Even war in theory can be ended. Bigotry can too, but you're just gonna have to deal with being called gay on Twitter I'm sorry I'm not staying in hell. Satan probably barely even rules over hell, hes probably just another prisoner there.<br>
<br>
I. Was the first crush in your life something you had or something someone had on you?<br>
Idk lol, i dont keep track<br>
<br>
J. Could you live without having sex ever (again) in exchange for eternal youth?<br>
I didn't have sex in the first place<br>
<br>
K. Have you ever watched a full length pornographic movie?<br>
I have not gotten my full reddit moderator license yet.<br>
<br>
L. The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?<br>
Idk<br>
<br>
M. If you could have the ability to manipulate matter or energy, which would you choose?<br>
Neither, dont wanna fuck up some shit and kill everyone<br>
<br>
N. What was the worst nightmare you ever had?<br>
idk either<br>
<br>
O. Would you rather spend one year with your one true love just to never see them again or the rest of your life with second best?<br>
2nd best obviously<br>
<br>
P. All the sequels/remakes/adaptations/rip-offs in movies nowadays, good or bad?<br>
some good, most bad<br>
<br>
Q. Would you rather be dirt poor and emotionally fulfilled in life or be rich beyond imagination and emotionally dissatisfied for life?<br>
how does a rich person become emotionally dissatisfied again? you fucking have everything. u have 2 wiius dude<br>
<br>
R. Do you have any (secret) feelings of bigotry to any group of people?<br>
I ain't telling u bro<br>
<br>
S. Would you rather be the only person in the world that can read minds or have everyone else in the world be able to read minds except for your own?<br>
reading minds obviously<br>
<br>
T. If everyone in the world would automatically only know one language, which language would you choose?<br>
English<br>
<br>
V. A world without religion, good, bad, neutral?<br>
Bad for the most part as most reasonable people (religious or not), don't support a lot of the crazy shit a few unhinged people do that happen to be religious.<br>
<br>
W. The men's rights movement, legitimate cause or laughable, and why?<br>
Laughable because as a non-w*mxn myself, we got male power bitch. Get back to the dishes and make me a sandwhich while you're at it (dear moderators, i am joking and this is satire).<br>
<br>
X. You can eliminate one of your five senses to substantially strengthen the others, which one and would you do it?<br>
get rid of smell, majorly enhance others if i had to pick. otherwise, i wouldnt change anything<br>
<br>
Y. Do looks mean anything to you? Don't lie, could you fall in love with someone you thought was ugly?<br>
i could easily do so lmao.

<summary>(OUTDATED) Discord TOS Updates - Privacy Intrusions? | 3/8/2023  7:26PM</summary>
GREAT NEWS: Privacy Policy/TOS or whatever was changed so this wouldn't happen. Thank you Discord.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230323043946/https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=100945">New blog</a>
<br><br>
If you want, proceed to read the old blog anyways.
<hr>
So recently discord announced a new TOS. Whatever right? They're probably restricting free speech or some other thing they don't like more like most websites have been in the past few years. However, this TOS update is different because it might imply Discord could start recording calls. As if it wasn't bad enough what Discord does or doesn't do already.
<hr>
Obviously, the full TOS is very long so I don't expect you to read through it so images will be below with both the older TOS link and the new TOS link. Also, it will contain internet archive versions of said links.
<br><br>
<a href="https://discord.com/terms/privacy-policy-march-2022#3">Old TOS</a> + <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230309011347/https://discord.com/terms/privacy-policy-march-2022">Archived Old TOS</a><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100912_1.jpg">
<br><br>
<a href="https://discord.com/terms/privacy-policy">New TOS</a> + <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230307063534/https://discord.com/terms/privacy-policy">Archived New TOS</a><br>
<img src="/Media/Archives/Post-Media/SDK-100912_2.jpg">
<br><hr>You probably noticed the words below for the old TOS if you clicked on it (and you obviously saw it in the picture).
<blockquote>We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>We also don’t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time.</blockquote>
Should we really trust discord to not mess it up? Like really, should we? This doesn't seem good for the future at all. Obviously discord has a lot of pedos, but I highly doubt they will actually try solving that and instead use this as an excuse to ban people they don't like. I get if its just trying to counter pedos, however its a pretty shitty way they're attempting it and it probably won't even work unless you have someone always watching each and every move (which would be a privacy concern).
<hr>
Overall, this change does not seem good for Discord. If you weren't convinced already that Discord was going downhill, this is where I would start really being concerned. Whether you break TOS or not probably doesn't matter to them, they just want control. I'd recommend never using Discord for VCs again and instead using <a href="https://guilded.gg/">Guilded</a> or another service. You'll thank me later if things get worse.
<br><br>
Before I end off the blog, I will say how its funny that Pokemon XY/ORAS voice chat service for friends seems more safe at this point than a website/app designed for the purpose of messaging/calls. What a crazy world we live in for Pokemon to be less tracked.

So im currently working towards the 500 blog goal. This would give me a 6 star author badge which would be cool.
<br><br>
Doing that will likely make the archives much better especially if the blogs are big instead of short things that can quickly be typed on a DSi.
<br><br>
I'm currently also trying to figure out why the old GuiedGui JS copy/paste isn't working right. When I'm on PC again soon, I'll figure it out and update the guide via a new blog.
<br><br>
Credit will be given to GuiedGui of course by linking his blog. Find it funny I'm unironically using the Pokemon XY/ORAS voice chat to call Paint members lol.
<br><br>
Well theres not much left to say, this blog is almost done for. Thanks for reading, check out the archives by <a href="https://dc-blog.neocities.org/Archives">clicking this link</a>. I'm done for now lol (on PC i'll update the archives again).

<summary>Sigma Bloggin 4 | 3/12/2023 3:56pm</summary>
Im currently getting tons of sources ready for a full group page about the SDK discord to make fun of it. I realized theres way more than i thought, it needs a full page.
<br><br>
I will be eventually removing the sdk section from the Hall of Shame but only after fully transferring to a new page.
<br><br>
Also, yes in case you haven't figured out by now, i have been spying on the server ever since i saw how much stupid shit was said.
<br><br>
You have noticed me doing it already with the hall of shame, you see it now. its pointless to pretend not to see it but then go into a public server that im spying on and say you see it because i see it as well.
<br><br>
Y'all really should just make a group called "End TDK Spam" and use it as an attempt to stop me. It'll fail, I'll probably spy on it too, I'll keep winning.
<br><br>
TDK Community always wins, SDKPaint Discord always loses. Is this a one sided-war? Basically (until 3 months later someone will post it in the server for my entertainment). Do I care? Nah lol its fun.
<br><br>
I dare you to ratio me in the comments SDK server, watch as I win. Just remember the more you post, the more I win. Stop posting about me, I can't make fun of you.
<br><br>
Tbh if I pretended to be a new member and spied on the server, it could work assuming the paint admins didn't find out that the paint account is an alt. Not really anything left to say, thanks for reading.

<summary>Nearly 2 Years of 3DSPaint | 3/13/2023 1:39pm</summary>
Hello everyone. As of today, we have only 1 month until 1 year of 3DSPaint. This is quite a beautiful accomplishment. We are once again closer to taking over paint. I will not go over too much, but this is cool still.
<br><br>
Currently we're top group and near the top of the badge collectors. Granted I want to save things for my 2y anniversary blog, so we won't discuss much. I could be at a gold poster badge if HullBreach fixes the Bulletin Boards soon but I'm not sure when they will be done.
<br><br>
Whatever lol, I just felt like announcing that. Huge W, I approve.

<summary>The End of Turtle Society | 3/15/2023 1:14am</summary>
It is the end of our 2nd biggest competitor, Turtle Society. TDK/DC Empire is getting closer to taking over paint permanently. It is true, you can't deny it. We're staying ahead again despite crocodile/crocodile2 leaving. So this is pretty good. We will keep mass-inviting people to finally be able to do it.
<br><br>
So there is an issue with gaining members though, how do we gain so many people that we can keep people from leaving once or twice then killing all the effort we've done with the group thus-far? It will become harder as we gain members because Paint isn't expected to have so many people in 2023. We will have to actually make sure those who join don't leave or keep relying on accounts that are alive once then die.
<br><br>
However I also want it to be actually active instead of big but no activity because that isn't fun. Granted, TDK has shown there are still around 50 people or so that are active here and as a result, we can tell there's an audience thats active. Getting the members to never delete their paint accounts and stay at least semi-active is the challenge.
<br><br>
I don't know honestly, I just am happy that I'm gonna have an easier time again lol. However after a few days I won't be able to sneak around and view crocodile2's CSS so I will have to actually start learning very soon. Whatever honestly, it would help me a lot anyways. Java Script too, but that wouldn't be on Paint for obvious reasons.
<br><br>
I won't keep wasting much time, TDK Supremacy. We win, TS lost again. Common crocodile2 L, glad he also won't be spamming us again finally. I will keep the DC Empire group ahead though. Thanks for reading, bye for now.

<summary>The Night of Paint Deadism | 3/15/2023 1:56am</summary>
So I'm writing this starting at 1:42am and paint is current dead as expected lol. Pretty funny. Whatever lol, it feels peaceful. I'm listening to Mobb Deep right now, everyone is offline, this blog is being written. I usually don't feel as much peace as doing that during this time. It feels nice, at night I like it.
<br><br>
Normally I'm constantly checking groups, constantly DMing, constantly working on something. However at nearly 2am in the morning with little to do because I usually finish all I can physically force myself to do then some, it feels... peaceful. Something I'm not really that used to. I like just how calm it is.
<br><br>
No thoughts about wanting to own members, no avoiding the admins, no messages except a blog comment 6 hours later, etc. I could really start getting into this type of stuff. I would just do stuff like this if I didn't want to risk losing the empire, I have to stay grinding to stay ahead of everyone. If I ain't the best and I don't enjoy it as much, whats the point?
<br><br>
I enjoy paint so I wouldn't leave obviously, but what I don't enjoy is constantly having to work to keep groups higher up just because there isn't anyway to simply click a "Join Group" button so I don't have to mass invite others like normal even when my group is literally public. It would be cool if we got that, would make the job easier to me.
<br><br>
I've recently noticed that I have been writing a ton more than usual. And I mean actually unique stuff instead of just archiving some old blogs or spamming copypastas/sending DMs + group messages. It does feel weird as well, normally I'm in DC Empire right now. Everything about peaceful nights where everyone is offline feels both weird but calm.
<br><br>
Calm because its silent and easy to do stuff, weird because its silent as well. Even on Paint, I'm used to constant shit happening. These nights like this where I'm not really working on much is always gonna be fun. Believe me when I say it takes tooooooooons of effort to do this shit. I have to manage 10s of thousands of lines of code with most of it just being old shit that keeps getting new content. Its easy, but its fun barely having to do that after finishing archives.
<br><br>
Considering I basically did the archives not once but twice, you have to admit I am good at what I do. Abiding by Neocities 500 file limit before being unable to download your stuff isn't fun either but I've done it successfully. Just making the SDKPaint archives not be on seperate pages probably both helped with the file limit and the 1GB size limit.
<br><br>
Unlike other archives, SDKCommunity is way bigger mostly due to blogs and paintings. However blogs were made to such an extent that it gets hard making sure things don't lag the Neocities editor when doing it because if it does then I basically can't make the editing do shit. I actually seperated into years due to that.
<br><br>
The page would just lag too much and it would take forever to go to the bottom when trying to do the archives, granted its nice being able to see who made each blog, what year, exactly when/title, and the blog itself. I think I have a perfect system for the amount I'm doing on a fully static website. No chatrooms even.
<br><br>
As for chatrooms, I could re-add them however I would want to find something where I don't risk IPs being visible. I don't trust that it'll be safe even if only I can supposedly see IPs. That is not a risk I am willing to take at all especially as of now so I will just avoid it altogether. However, if I find an alternative to Cbox that doesn't do that then I will gladly make a new page for a chatroom.
<br><br>
There isn't much else for me to say anymore, things are getting long even on PC so DSi will probably go crazy with this much text. Thanks for reading this blog, I don't have anything else to say at this point and I will likely go to bed in a few minutes-1h max.

<summary>Donald Trump - Paint Edition | 3/16/2023 2:31am</summary>
Donald Trump of Paint here, I see the SDKPaint discord a bit mad yet again. I will keep watching over. TDK Supremacy, TDK never dies. Hey wait a minute why hasn't the discord made a anti-tdk channel? That would be pretty cool tbh. Just a suggestion, I already probably am more mentioned in most channels than everyone else except admins (if even them).
<br><br>
I will gladly take Draconid_Jo's test results of 14 on my side with 2 against me as a lot of evidence alone the server isn't supported now, but whatever. Remember how I said I was always watching in some older blogs? Well I think people are finally seeing that and it shows. Damn they should see the updated Hall of Shame. I might start adding more to it if needed but whatever.
<br><br>
I could make all the images Base64 so if I had to ban-evade, I'd be back in literal days. You would have to constantly spy on my website just to even figure out my new account (because I will likely make archives like I usually do). Until I get banned or they quit, I will stay grinding for 500 blogs. At this point I archive almost as soon as I release.
<br><br>
As a result, getting banned now should only affect my groups and badges. After a certain point, its hard to give a shit about badges if you get banned and can't get unbanned likely (or it will be years until the unban probably). I've been having a lot of fun writing these blogs essentially discussing whatever in them.
<br><br>
Paint drama, random shit, etc. I will keep doing this (likely several times daily as well) all the way until the death of TDK on Paint. Banning me will not be enough for me to stop going here, HullBreach will have to block my IP(s) from even viewing the website let alone creating an account. And even then I might be back, just not for a while.
<br><br>
I would argue I am the most controversial member in the past 2 years nearly. People did worse than me and got banned, but they never managed to stay just annoying/edgy enough to be controversial for long without getting banned. Very few have matched me at this point and I'm pretty glad to have the title of being semi-controversial on the site.
<br><br>
Being controversial is only risky if the admins don't like you from what I can tell. Its pretty obvious why, other members can hate you but if all the admins love you then they'll rarely ban you unless you're just too annoying. Don't let them claiming its equal change ur mind about it, its obvious to them all. This is why I declare myself almost the most controversial ever.
<br><br>
Yes people have actually said the nword and gotten banned such as Dood421. However did 99% of controversial people have a near-top group (keeps going back and forth by like 1-2 people), live near-rent free in admin/members heads, and are mostly only hated by people who themselves don't actually care about paint? Yea, not many have.
<br><br>
Personally I must say if it were up to me, Draconid_Jo is getting overlord. I've said it a ton, but he's done a pretty good job. I endorse Draconid_Jo as overlord, I would give him it considering he will try to be active as much as he can. If he didn't have to for SDK friends, he probably would just straight up quit Discord. Hell same for me now, fuck Discord Privacy Policy as of March 2023.
<br><br>
Idk lol, its 2:31am before I end it off so yea. I need to go to sleep now, I probably shouldn't be up much later after putting this blog in the archives. Thanks for reading, admins cringe 99% of the time, get owned liberals.

<summary>DC Wins Against SDKcord | 3/16/2023 3:33pm</summary>
Well we won pretty much. Despite it being more active in the past 2 days than ever, despite there being the proof right there, it is ignored LOL. Well whatever tbh, that pretty much is admission they lost by ignoring the proof which debunks the sent messages. We win u lose get owned ratio.
<br><br>
I will take this as a victory and just go back to being edgy but ignoring the server as long as they don't mention me. Aaron (aka Thi500) is saying one thing correct as fucking stupid as he is, stop giving me attention. I'm only continuing this because y'all respond to it (and also because I just want Star Shadow to admit the ban isn't DC racist, not to unban me).
<br><br>
Whatever lol, TDK W as I've been saying. If you want a better discord server, just join Draconid_Jo's server because its actually good unlike the SDKPaint server. Get rekt admins, I won u lost.

<summary>L4D2 - Steam Gift | 3/16/2023 3:40pm</summary>
So, based I just got Left 4 Dead 2 on Steam. Thank you to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lerrycapetime">Astonishingly Awesome</a> on Steam, I will be playing this game a ton LMAO.

<summary>My experience with L4D2 | 3/17/2023 12:21am</summary>
So as you know I finally got Left 4 Dead 2 on steam. I played a round with the guy who gave me the game and honestly it was fun. I actually could get into this game, simple but fun. I could make a video, but idk when I would be able to.
<br><br>
Whatever lol, fun game i recommend. I will maybe make a video review on my YouTube channel whenever I play it much more though, a blog might not even do it and I need more for my YT channel.

<summary>DISCORD TOS UPDATE - It Was Changed | 3/22/2023 11:35pm</summary>
Thank GOD. It was changed, I will stay in VCs unless there is a good reason to stop such as them changing their mind about generally refraining from that. Holy shit I was about to get every reason to quit discord. I will list the new TOS with its changes compared to the old new one.
<br><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230307063534/https://discord.com/terms/privacy-policy">Old Updated Privacy Policy</a>
<br><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230323043323/https://discord.com/terms/privacy-policy">New Privacy Policy (for now)</a>
<br><br>
Well until then, I have called off the end of Discord for me. But only for now, VCs make discord worth it because literally everything else is so heavily moderated not even by discord but mods and VCs are for people who like the freedom such as myself, I don't trust them with VCs even if I ain't breaking TOS or doing anything that bad. VCs being recorded by Discord themselves literally serves no purpose other than censorship for no reason, I'm glad they reversed it.

<summary>Closer to 2y of paint | 3/22/2023 11:55pm</summary>
I have realized that my 2y anniversary on this site is not far away now. I still won't go over much, but this is (as said previously) pretty cool. Idk what really to say, we are close to 300 blogs on paint though. It is not the most of every member, there is someone I saw with a 6 star author badge but whatever. Whenever I hit 1k, I probably won't write much more because I literally couldn't.
<br><br>
How will I get to 1k within a reasonable time? I will be doing 500 this year, but idk how I can do 1k easily. Maybe 2024? Idk, 1k blogs will be hard to reach but it would get me that godly gold star like a real sigma would have. Very nice, TDK Supremacy.

<summary>The DSi Browser Fall And Its Future | 3/23/2023 12:21am</summary>
I'm still trying to find DSi compatible websites, so many sites just don't work though. Not even Legacy Mobile Reddit works, and Black Dragon RPG im surprised works. I will try to find more RPGs and other sites to use on DSi, but it will be a hard task. Most are dead and aren't even intended for DSi so they will have issues.
<br><br>
Paint is the only DSi site still working semi-properly sadly. RIP DSi Browser, that thing is almost at its end. If this site dies, the browser is basically worthless again other than for Black Dragon RPG. I would actually have to start working to get a Paint replacement if that happened. Granted, not being able to use paint means I have a need to actually improve my skills for more than just fun.
<br><br>
At that point, the entire DSi browser community would need someone to make a new site that works, and I would have to provide or let the empire down. I can't just let DCE die like that after all (or at least TDK anyways). I must keep the empires alive, and help keep the DSi stuff alive. I got no domain, no way to host, but I will figure out more than just Base64.
<br><br>
Base64 works, but it is unstable and I can't easily update it for others so they have to keep somehow updating it. You can see why that would go wrong. All I need is some way to force a site to work on DSi, I don't even care if it works well. I just want it to "work" to some extent such as with Black Dragon RPG. Thats it, just functioning if barely.
<br><br>
We are at the end of times for this browser and its not good. Even the O3DS browser is coming to its end within a few years due to the lowering number of compatible sites (unlike DSi, some sites work well and Nintendo has their own semi-workable messaging system via Swapdoodle at least). N3DS has a while to go especially while Legacy Mobile Reddit still works along with several Neocities sites + YouTube and more. Wii U is in the same boat as N3DS but a few less sites (or maybe more).
<br><br>
RIP DSi Browser Community<br>
2009-????

<summary>DOWEEAFHVE SPPIRALLLLL | 3/23/2023 10:21pm</summary>
Hello my fellow idiots, welcome to the DOWNWARDS SPIRALLYWXV OJUFDETIJFJER. Paint is based, TDK Supremacy.
<br><br>
Ok jokes aside, thats it for this blog. A hilarious and original shitpost, tthanks 4 reading.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How will i continue | 3/24/2023 12:47am</summary>
Ok so as you know I mass shitpost/make stuff on blogs whether for paint or other sites. Currently I'm trying to figure out how to increase my shitpost count on GBAtemp too. I need to increase my blog count.
<br><br>
The further I go, the better. I need stuff for my archives after all so shitposts help. Also, the forums in general help if I make a forum post about something whether GBAtemp, Kuribo64, or another place.
<br><br>
Speaking of which, I wanna make it look more like an actual forum and make things look better. I'm not making a ton of pages that act like a forum, that would never work similarly to the SDKCommunity archive file limit issues.
<br><br>
500 file limit isn't a lot at all for me, but I'm also putting most of my stuff on a single website (or trying to). As a result, I'm not surprised it ain't much to me and I will just have to deal with it.
<br><br>
I have to be careful about writing too much in a day or else archiving will be hard later. I'm considering archiving my Black Dragon RPG forum posts in @Dood421's Hell Riders clan along with [TDK] Chromium but I'm not sure yet. Would add a bit to the archives which I need.
<br><br>
Archives will likely always have their own unique CSS despite not having it probably saving space. Wouldn't look unique at all and would be hard to fix in the archives.
<br><br>
Idk, there ain't really anymore I can say for this blog. Thanks for reading, I'm done for now honestly fuck this.

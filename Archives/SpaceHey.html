<summary>I joined</summary>
I recently heard of this site. I never used original Myspace though. Heard of this on Bwitter and SubRocks. I make animations I guess. I like video games too.

<summary>Website Redesign/Reorganization, Major Improvements Again</summary>
Once again I am remaking the look of my website. Yes, I feel legally required to do so. I have no clue why, but whatever lol.
<p>Starting off, we have the archive section. This section is being remade to be a bit different. Already, we have been moving everything onto very few pages to stay within the 500 file limit of Neocities (well if you want to download your website easily that is), but we will try to cut down on worthless stuff further such as 3D Photo Gallery stuff being in a single folder.</p>
<p>TMJ tiles will also just be a .zip thats linked as a Base64 file because these images are really, really small (like 48 of them can be less than 15kb). Flipnote Archives will be put on hold until I can figure out a better way to upload the archives.</p>
<p>They take up more space then I want them too and they make the page lag a ton because its just Base64 text which isn't actually that efficient for most cases. However, the other archives will be worked on still especially while I can't figure out Flipnote archives.</p>
<p>Thats not all however because I am also remaking the entire blog system. Basically, it will be an actual blog instead of essentially just text thats thrown all over the place. I may remake some older blogs if the topic itself is actually a good one.</p>
<p>Before I end this off, I will start talking about website games. I might just make games for the DC-Blog website. Simple text-based games, but games nonetheless. Now I will have to figure out how to efficiently do this stuff because I don't want it too laggy and I like games running on N3DS.</p>
<p>I may put Red Crystal RPG which is a DSiPaint blog game onto my website after I finish it (except updated a bit because I don't have to do tons of BS to only kinda get it working lol) which would be the first of the games.</p>
<p>Not much else to say, thanks for reading lol. These changes should be done soon, click the link below to view my website. It might work on O3DS models, but I am not sure so I will have to see if someone can test it as I don't have O3DS, only N3DS.</p>

<summary>The SpaceHey Archives</summary>
I have decided to start archiving the little content I have on SpaceHey. Pretty cool lol. I will be making it fit onto a single page too so that will be nice. You will have to click the ID thingy to go wherever you want lol. It should work pretty fast and as a result, very minimum lag if any (mostly because I don't have tons of fancy animations and stuff)
<br><br>
Not much else to say other than to check out the archives lol.

I will probably be done with the archives by tonight, there is basically nothing. Forums I might not even end up adding stuff in, I just have it there tbh.

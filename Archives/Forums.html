Introduce yourselves in this forum! You may give your 3DSPaint name. Thank you for using this forum.
<hr>
I will start us off.
<br><br>
I am Analog Cheese, the alt of @digitalcheese on this website for this clan in specific. I would just make the clan on there but I am already in Hell Riders and I do not want to leave the clan.
<br><br>
As a result, I am on this account! My 3DSPaint name is DCTheGamr if you need to contact me (my other socials are there anyways). If you are on DSi, you may feel free to use DSiPaint which is basically the same thing.

<summary>Nintendo 3DS/Wii U eShop Shutdown | 3/26/23 10:04pm</summary>
Well this is it. We are officially at the end of the 3DS/Wii U's eShop. As of March 27th, 2023, you will no longer be able to do the following:
<br><br>
- Download Games/Apps Not Previously Purchased<br>
- Sync Funds On Switch For Use On 3DS/Wii U
<br><br>
There are a few things you still can do as of now, but they may be unavailable one day in the future. However, luckily it should be very far into the future considering even the Wii/DSi's shops allow you to do some of the listed things below.
<br><br>
- Sync Funds From 3DS/Wii U Onto Switch To Buy Games There<br>
- Re-Download Previously Purchased Games/Apps<br>
- Update Games/Other Software<br>
- Download Some Free Themes On 3DS
<br><br>
Either way, RIP 3DS/Wii U eShop. You will be missed. 2011-2023. I expect game prices to go up soon especially for Pokemon. If you want to install new games, either find the cartridge and dump them or do something by going somewhere that I don't think I can say here because its illegal technically (even if basically impossible to enforce).

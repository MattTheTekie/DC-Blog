Sigma DC has arrived. God damn a 5k character limit too? W - Mar 09, 2023, 2:59 PM

I might make a Fediverse archive on my website soon, that way I'll be able to add Fediverse posts as time goes on (such as these) assuming I consider them important enough.<br><br>
It will have the exact date of the post too and if I can do the [ID] CSS right, it'll even be sorted by what instance lmao. Should be pretty cool. I'll probably replace every website I used with my site in like the next 10 years at this point lmaoooooo.<br><br>
The only reason content would be edited is if I had to actually give two shits about copyright or some other BS law lmao. Otherwise, it would be exactly how it was then for the Fediverse archives. - Mar 09, 2023, 7:35 PM

The basically non-existant Fediverse archive exists now.<br>

Mastodon will be hard for me to get used to, trying to figure out which hosts allow you to interact with them and which don’t with a service like Federated Naters being “controversial”.<br><br>
Its still pretty cool tbh, I like it. I might one day host myself but idk honestly. Either way, I’m starting to like the idea of Mastodon a lot. I prefer 3DSPaint still, but this is a cool idea.<br><br>
If I did host my own instance, I wouldn’t be blocking this one if it still exists then. Administration would actually be good unlike a lot of lefty/liberal hosts, fucking liberals ruin shit LMAO.<br><br>
Well since I can go on forever essentially, I might as well keep typing. I’ve been doing website updates still with archives. Domain soon? Idk, but if I do and then get neocities supporters for $5 monthly eventually then that would be helpful.<br><br>
However before I do that, I need to find a justifiable reason to get it. I don’t even have close to 1GB of storage and I don’t have tons of mp3 files to upload either. That would justify it to me due to the bigger size of those files.<br><br>
I do think with that type of storage I could start a podcast maybe? Idk lmao, would be cool. I’m a retard with an internet connection and HTML/CSS (not even JS) so it could be done.<br><br>
Damn so I’ve been typing for a while and this bitch still got space. Huge W for me. The archives will show how little I’ve actually written at least on PC but still. Mastodon actually might be Twitter but better.<br><br>
Considering you can do stuff like higher/basically infinite character limits, markdown, and more, it really is seeming fair to use Mastodon more. Granted its annoying how Mastodon can be at times.<br><br>
Either way, I will be using more perhaps. And we still are going, daaaaaamn. Idk, I’ll probably end this off soon so it doesn’t go forever.<br><br>
I might start deleteing some old accounts I have on other websites I don’t use. Most likely the tons of dead youtube clones I’ve joined and now basically left and don’t even upload on. Did it with one already.<br><br>
Discord getting worse on the day, I’m moderating 2 servers currently and simply in another 2 but like discord is gonna die if this keeps up. They’re encouraging everyone to leave basically. Can’t believe there was once a time where I considered Discord to be the best and its already one of the worst of the ones here just due to the new policy.<br><br>
Guilded staying better, fuck discord. Reddit banned me too, it sucked for a while tho. Twitch hasn’t done anything, but it sucks too. YouTube is practically the only ok-ish of the mainstream websites and even its shit.<br><br>
I swear people are fucking stupid, why would any logical person ever want to use a lot of these websites other than for the chance of getting bigger whenever for most of them there are better options?<br><br>
YT only has TikTok (which is worse) so I can see why thats used. Twitch is shit now Reddit is so censored that it holds it back. The website would literally be perfect if it didn’t censor you so much. Twitter is Twitter. Discord is killing itself.<br><br>
Whenever a 2009 DSi/2011 3DS website is better than this mainstream site, you know its bad. And I mean really bad. I will celebrate when most of them die at this point. Stopping my use of these websites almost feels amazing.<br><br>
For years I would constantly use YouTube/Discord. YT i still do, but discord i only use somewhat ever since the ban. Honestly it was what I needed. Freedom from the old servers I owned/moderated, an excuse to start leaving after losing that shit, etc.<br><br>
I took a huge W by starting my final leave of most of these places. Now that I’ve optimized some stuff on my website, I can replace most websites with just it or 3DSPaint. Paint admins never gonna get me and if they do I’ll be back in a few days orless.<br><br>
No one would even report me, I practically have the entire website on my side (which isn’t much, but theres barely 50 people active nowadays if that). I could be racist and get away with it which is what they want me banned for in the first place.<br><br>
Idk lol, I’m finally starting to run low on characters so I will just end it off. I can’t keep talking much longer. Other than that, I’ve been listening to Mobb Deep on YouTube a lot lmao. Pretty good, recommend it.<br><br>
Ok finally I’m actually gonna stop writing now, I could literally just make this a status on my website at this point. Thanks for reading this essay lol. - Mar 15, 2023, 12:31 AM

I see a verification checkmark now - Mar 20, 2023, 11:04 AM

<div id=RyonaAgency><h3>DC Joins Ryona Agency</h3>
Well it is official, I have joined a new Mastodon instance. I happen to have a Federated Naters Mastodon instance so ye. From what I've noticed, Mastodon is way better than I originally thought.<br><br>
I probably would've joined instances sooner if it didn't just seem fully like a ton of Twitter clones but a slightly bigger character limit and worse in other ways. This looks way more fun now than it originally did.<br><br>
Idk lol, I will probably archive most of my Mastodon posts onto my website as well so W. I don't have much to say so from here I will just end off this post for now, thanks for reading I guess.
</div>
</div><br>
<div class=footer>Neither Mastodon nor any instances hosted encourage this archive or are affilated with it. Please do not go and harass anyone mentioned in the archives. Thank you for reading.

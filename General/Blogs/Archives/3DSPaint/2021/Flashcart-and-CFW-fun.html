<div class=PaintText><p1>So around a month ago I got an R4 and in March of this year I modded a DSi XL. The two of these combined make a perfect combination. Especially if the flashcart has a 16gb micro sd card and the DSi has a 32GB SD Card (not micro).</p1>

<p1>Recently I played Mario Kart DS with cheats and it was great. I had a Big Luigi I could control. I can also dump GBA games on DS Phat/DS Lite (but I am having trouble with that as of now because even if I go to the folder its dumped in, I can't play the game).</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>Pretty much what I am saying is that it's great. Crazy to think that I never used these for many years up until now. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to mod systems.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>Its way too easy now xD. Even I was able to mod 6 systems so far. Four being mine and 2 were my friends 3DSes).</p1>

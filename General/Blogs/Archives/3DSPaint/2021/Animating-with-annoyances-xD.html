<div class=PaintText><p1>Just been animating with Flipnote Studio 3D. One annoyance with my touch screen on 3DS and another since I am using a phone hotspot while letting my sibling put on some songs but they aren't good (to me anyways). One of the songs being Let it Go and another being Baby Shark. Other than that it's a fun Flipnote time.</p1></div>

<div class="main-text">Blogs if they're shorter and more so just unhinged rants about whatever. Note that depending on when you are reading these, they may have now outdated info/dead links. I will try to archive everything via the Internet Archive, but that doesn't always end up happening.

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=BlogUpdates2>More Updates</h2>
I removed essays and just made it one page. Despite the blogs length, they can all fit on one page and still load properly so why bother. I don't exactly know what I'm doing but whatever lol. Hopefully I can do things here cool, if so then W. If you have any ideas, go to the homepage and click my 3DSPaint account to DM me about it. Otherwise, I think I will keep my blogs like an actual blog all on one page due to the sheer amount I will likely have along with the Neocities limits. Oh also I'm using my CSS BBCodes some more so W. - 3/14/2023 3:32pm

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=BlogUpdates>Update to the Blog system</h2>
So I did a 3DSPaint poll and everyone has decided it would be better to make blogs on seperate pages each instead of just one page. I will consider this after polling a few other people just to be sure and if the majority still vote for seperate pages, I will do it. I will have to figure out how to reduce the files needed further as to prevent issues with Neocities downloading of websites at least until I can pay for Neocities supporter and download it anyways via WebDAV or whatever it is. - 3/7/2023

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=Layout1>CSS Updates</h2>
My website was horrible for people who liked to actually have good working eyes. Pink, black, and white don't go good especially after adding a blue box/text shadow. Finally looks better, I literally used a picture of my wall so it would work lol.

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=Testing>Testing</h2>
So I just got the status system up and running. I will apply the status link to the homepage so you are able to view it. Idk, this is a cool idea for things that don't need their own blog entry or entire page.

<div class="main-text">Blogs if they're shorter and more so just unhinged rants about whatever. Note that depending on when you are reading these, they may have now outdated info/dead links. I will try to archive everything via the Internet Archive, but that doesn't always end up happening.

<div class="main-text"><h2>Neocities Supporters</h2>
I have just gotten <p1 class=aurora>Neocities supporters</p1>! Finally, 50GB of storage, 3000GB of bandwidth, and no file type limit. Also WebDAV for mounting my site as a hard drive which is pretty cool to think about.
<br><br>
Very cool, I will be updating some things to be their regular file type instead of using Base64 such as my Flipnote archive and my videos/music that I will eventually put on this website. W, W, and W. Ws everywhere you look now. Neocities based, I approve. - 3/24/2023 4:25pm

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=TDKUpdates>TDK Website Stuff</h2>
So as you might already know, I've been working on the TDK website. So far things have been going well. I've been trying to figure out the nav-bar a lot along with TDK blogs for updates. Maybe there will be a fan-content section? Idk. It would be a good idea and I could feature YT videos. I will obviously keep working on this website like usual, however I will note things may slow down because I am working on TDK. Also, I've reached the limit of things I can archive here for now. I don't have anything left to do.
<br><br>
Custom CSS Classes for more text will be added eventually so it won't just be <p1 class=neon>neon text</p1> and <p1 class=long>long text</p1> which will be nice. I will be able to start heavily styling my pages here. Expect more colorful/animated text here. It is just using classes so it could apply to either regular paragraphs, links, or even header text which is cool. The more cool CSS the better, CSS based. I still have to learn Javascript but if I do this year than this website will start having JS.
<br><br>
JS is where things will start getting complicated. At that point, I would have a ton I could redesign and make more optimized if I did it right. Also, I could probably start making actual games on this website which would be cool. I like the idea of making a game such as Red Crystal RPG for 3DSPaint/DSiPaint blogs but with JS instead so it'll actually work right and won't just be a "click things 500 times until you win" game. I would have to figure out a saving system or make the game simple tho whatever.
<br><br>
YouTube I will also be trying to go somewhere with again. I need to grow the account, it'll get more people here too. I will keep adding art to my website as well, so W. Thank you Media section of this website. I don't really have anything else to talk about here so this will be the end of this status. Thanks for reading, TDK Supremacy. - 3/22/2023 11:08pm

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=BlogUpdates2>More Updates</h2>
I removed essays and just made it one page. Despite the blogs length, they can all fit on one page and still load properly so why bother. I don't exactly know what I'm doing but whatever lol. Hopefully I can do things here cool, if so then W. If you have any ideas, go to the homepage and click my 3DSPaint account to DM me about it. Otherwise, I think I will keep my blogs like an actual blog all on one page due to the sheer amount I will likely have along with the Neocities limits. Oh also I'm using my CSS BBCodes some more so W. - 3/14/2023 3:32pm

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=BlogUpdates>Update to the Blog system</h2>
So I did a 3DSPaint poll and everyone has decided it would be better to make blogs on seperate pages each instead of just one page. I will consider this after polling a few other people just to be sure and if the majority still vote for seperate pages, I will do it. I will have to figure out how to reduce the files needed further as to prevent issues with Neocities downloading of websites at least until I can pay for Neocities supporter and download it anyways via WebDAV or whatever it is. - 3/7/2023

<div class="main-text"><h2 id=Layout1>CSS Updates</h2>
My website was horrible for people who liked to actually have good working eyes. Pink, black, and white don't go good especially after adding a blue box/text shadow. Finally looks better, I literally used a picture of my wall so it would work lol.
</div><br>
<div class="main-text"><h2 id=Testing>Testing</h2>
So I just got the status system up and running. I will apply the status link to the homepage so you are able to view it. Idk, this is a cool idea for things that don't need their own blog entry or entire page.

<p1>Thanks for visiting my website! If you would like to leave suggestions for me to see, DM me on discord. Dc#9535 is my tag. I will list a lot of my info about this site and other stuff here so you can view that if you want to. Until then, here is a long explanation of this site and my socials.</p1>
<br>
<h1>-----</h1>
<h1>The Beginning - 2015 to 2017</h1>
<br>
<p1>In May of 2015, I first joined the internet. This was my first time. This was where it all started. All the way back on Miiverse in 2015. It's been a long ride since then, but its a ride that was worth it I believe. I will not give my NNID as it contained my last name, but I made a few posts and even got to 10 followers. I mostly used on Wii U though I have one post from my 3DS (NNID is SuperFireLuigi1) so you can visit that <a href="https://archiverse.guide/user/SuperFireLuigi1">by clicking here</a>. If I one day decide to, I will give my Wii U NNID that contained my last name, but I want to avoid that for now. Idc if you have my first name though. Either way, I didn't do much here but there are old SMM1 levels with some of them still on official Nintendo servers somehow.</p1>
<br>
<h1>YouTube Beginnings - 2018 to Early 2019</h1>
<br>
<p1>I made my first YouTube channel in 2018 which also contained my last name apparently so I will not show it. But basically, every video fucking sucked which wasn't surprising because I was literally 9 at the time. This was where DC Empire started to actually be a thing, but it wasn't declared one yet. I lost that channel after forgetting the password and not having the email sadly. In mid-2019 though, I made a new YouTube channel that I still use today called <a href="https://youtube.com/DigitalCheese">Digital Cheese</a>. This was where DC Empire truly kicked off. I have a more detailed history that doesn't just include detailed explanations of highlights in the works (it includes minor details like more major channel updates and wars).</p1>
<br>
<h1>YouTube/Discord Expansions - Mid 2019 to Mid 2021</h1>
<br>
<p1>I had started to gain a very small following on YouTube which was pretty nice. Obviously, I knew I had to expand to other platforms so I went to Discord and made a server. It was never really active and was mostly for friends though. The first got destroyed due to a bot I added however, the 2nd one I made I just deleted. I had made another server called School World which went from something I'd want to use for my school to just being a server for general stuff before I finally changed to the 3rd and most recent DC Empire server. YouTube stayed dead for the most part. The 3rd server came later and not in this time (it was around late 2021), but whatever. School World was my biggest server from 2020-2021 as it got over 40 people even after removing bots from the total.</p1>
<br>
<h1>The Major Takeover - Mid 2021 to Early 2022</h1>
<br>
<p1>Around this time, I started using 3DSPaint more actively which is very fun (I still use it actively for my group). I made my group and a user by the name of blueturtle (who now goes by crocodile as his old account got banned I think), helped teach me CSS for my group. This was the first time I used CSS and he probably was part of the reason I actually decided to continue to teach myself HTML/CSS. I made a few other cool friends like Draconid_Jo, Weeeheep, and Itzako. The list would be long but whatever. I also started using tons of alt platforms including Neocities actually. I started doubling down on this shit because before I wasn't even trying and was mostly just having fun on Discord and shitposting on YouTube. One important thing was that I made a reddit account on August 2021 which will be important for my reddit empire.</p1>
<br>
<h1>Empire Success - Early 2022 to Current Day</h1>
<br>
<p1>Over 7 years after I first joined Miiverse, 4 years after joining YouTube, 3 years after joining discord, over 250 people later, we are at the current state of DC Empire. It's grown a ton and I've had it for the vast majority of my life (since I was 5 but nearly 6 at the time of my first Miiverse post). As much as it's grown, it still ain't over yet. I've made another empire called The Destruction Kingdom. This kingdom and DC Empire is being used together to create a powerful empire that can not be stopped. Currently I've been trying to colonize games such as Mario Kart and Destiny 2. TDK-DC never dies!11!!!!11!!!11! Jokes aside, you can easily join if you want but you'll have to DM me to get the link. Maybe we'll expand to a point of being unstoppable.</p1>

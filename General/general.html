<p1>So as you know, I have a decent bit of stuff here. I will layout all of the main pages here for your convenience although I might make a navigation of the entire website one day. Until then, here is a simple guide to get to basic pages easily.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Categories:</h1>
<p1><a href="/General/Blogs/blogs.html">Blogs</a></p1>
<br>
<p1><a href="General/Fun/fun.html">Fun</a></p1>
<br>
<p1><a href="">Achievements</a></p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>There isn't too much else for me to really explain. Most are obvious based off the names. The fun section has stuff like a chatroom for you to talk in with other people which is nice. If you want to actually have people to talk with, you can share the site wherever you want. There are some rules to the chatroom though for obvious reasons. Aka, we don't wanna get banned from Cbox.</p1>

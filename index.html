<p1>Hello! I am a YouTuber/Gamer named Digital Cheese aka DC. I usually spend my time playing video games, making YouTube/Odysee videos, and trolling along with making this website that you are on right now. I have a decent bit of stuff on this website and I have been redesigning it as of recently. If you would like to send me any ideas, please DM me on Discord. My Discord tag is Dc#9535. I would have claimed all caps DC, but there are too many people with their name in all caps like that so I had to make the letter "c" lowercase.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>So you may be wondering a little more about me. I make multiple types of content for those wondering. I make commentary, gaming, art videos, and even music. My biggest channel is the main one at over 150 subscribers. As for my other channels, they are a bit newer and have less than 10 subs per channel. I own one empire and one kingdom. DC Empire and The Destruction Kingdom are the names. DC Empire goes all the way back to 2015 and TDK is a bit more recent. I have been working on pages for the history of the empires which will be nice. If you want to partner with me, you will have to DM me (see above). I don't just partner with Discord servers and subreddits, I also partner with SpaceHey groups, 3DSPaint groups, etc. To become an ally with me, your group usually has to become very trusted or just straight up become a TDK colony in some cases. There have been a few people who have done it though so it isn't impossible. In total, DC Empire has over 250 people between every group. TDK doesn't have the numbers yet though its probably 50 at most between all TDK groups (including colonies).</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>I often troll on Twitter because it is very fun. If Twitter bans me, I'll go to TruthSocial and use my website more of course. I've made myself basically unbannable because of me being terminally online. I'd love for you to take me down on over 20 platforms with a lot of them not even caring about me if they even can without me straight up breaking the law. My biggest platforms are YouTube, Twitter, and Discord though I hope to get my <a href="https://odysee.com/$/invite/@DigitalCheese:1">Odysee Channel</a> bigger in the future of course. There really isn't too much else I could tell you about me that doesn't deserve it's own page. I will have all of my other platforms listed in it's own page because that list would be extremely long. If you want to, follow/subscribe to me on said platforms as it's greatly appricieated. Maybe I'll get to 200 subs by the end of this year on YouTube. Thanks for reading this short little page for now! Until then, go check out the other pages and gg well played.</p1>

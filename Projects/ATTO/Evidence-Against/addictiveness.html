<h1>Addictiveness for Kids</h1>
<p>TikTok is very addictive for kids. Kids already have been having shorter attention spans for a while now. Little kids especially will just watch the most stupid shit ever. Stuff like cocomelon which seems to just be colorful things for the most part with no real substance (and so colorful its addicting because little kids like bright colors). Now imagine a system where that can happen but then it is also able to be scrolled through which in turn ends up in very short attention spans. Even teenagers/adults are affected pretty hugely. There currently isn't too much for me to say because it is obvious why 8 year olds should not have TikTok when it comes to how addicting the app is.</p>
<h1>Addictiveness for Teenagers/Young Adults</h1>
<p>There is way more for us to say here as its way more important for teenagers to actually have an attention span (8 year olds don't need long attention spans other than for school mostly). There have been some teenagers who have gotten so small attention spans that even if you have severe ADHD, they would have a smaller attention span. 6 seconds is how short it got once in fact. Even when it doesn't get that short, it still gets extremely addicting and is designed to keep you hooked. Unlike other sites, the scrolling feature makes it easy to just go to the next video and TikTok is designed to show things that for the most part you enjoy (so its hard to get off it).</p>
<h1>Addictiveness for 25+ Adults</h1>
<p>It isn't as addictive for older adults because at that point, the human brain is fully developed and it would be harder for this stuff to happen so drastically. It still somewhat affects older adults to some extent, but not to the same extent as teenagers/kids.</p>
